  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œSo we gaily essayed the passage, which Jim accomplished safely; but just as the Skipper was stepping off his bridge on to the bank the treacherous bark gave way (this is the worst danger in walking on fallen trees), and with a mighty splash he and his rifle went into the deepest hole in the creek.  He thought it best to get out at once, but too late to save his watch, which he opened, and found that the escapement had floated round to the back of the mainspring and jammed the <span class="red">gadget</span> that the chunkerblock would not work.  But we were equal to the emergency, and in two minutes had frizzled all the water out of the works by unscrewing the large lens of the binocular and using it as a burning glass.  It had a wonderful effect, and with a little coaxing the watch began to go; then we hung it on a tree with the mechanism still exposed to the rays of the sun, and went on our way rejoicing.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œIf your engine has a linking in <span class="red">gadget</span> on the I.P. valve gear, it would be well to link it in a little, giving the I.P. a shorter cut off, and an increase of power in the I.P. cylinder would result and the H.P. would be decreased a corresponding amount, and the respective powers would even up to about 88 I.H.P. each.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œIn order to unite these plates by close-fitting joints, the contact surfaces were machined.  At the centre of an ordinary segment a hole was tapped to receive a 1.25 inch pipe.  This was the grout hole.  [â€¦]  The lug which, with the Hudson Companies, formed an integral part of the ordinary segment, was here omitted.  A <span class="red">gadget</span> was employed instead, in connection with a corresponding pair of bolt holes near the centre.  The device furnished a means by which the mechanical erector controlled the plate.  However, a great deal of placing was done by hand, in spite of the fact that all pieces except the key weighed a ton each.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œFig. 14 shows method of erecting the segments on the upper quarter.  The segments were attached to the erector bar by a <span class="red">gadget</span> with a large nut on one plain screwed end, and a flanged spigot on the other; the nut was run back far enough to insert the <span class="red">gadget</span>, and the nut was spun by hand very quickly to lock it in place.  This is a very effective way of lifting the segments and saved the expense of casting iron lugs on each segment.  The cast iron in the four tunnels represents about 100,000 tons; each segment weight about one ton, so about 100,000 lugs were saved.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œIf the conning tower is the brain of the ship, the engine-room is its heart.  When Jellicoe was speeding up to join Beatty and Evan-Thomas his whole fleet maintained a speed in excess of the trial speeds of some older vessels.  Think what skilful [sic] devotion this simple fact reveals, what minute attention day in day out for months and years, so that in the hour of need no mechanical <span class="red">gadget</span> may fail of its duty.  And as with Jellicoeâ€™s Fleet so all through the war.  Whenever the engine-rooms have been tested up to breaking strain they have always, always, stood up to the test.  I think less of the splendid work done by destroyer flotillas, by combatant officers and men in th ebig ships, by all those who have manned and directed within the light cruisers.  Their work was done within sight; that of the engine-rooms was hidden.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe distortion of the â€˜field sectionâ€™ or â€˜field sheetâ€™ due to changes of humidity and temperature, has been a thorn in the side of the topographer for many years, neither does there appear to be any means of eliminating it as long as the field sheet is of paper, or Bristol board, mounted upon a wooden board.

Experiment has proved, however, that a simple but ingenious arrangement can be fitted to the existing pattern of legs which provides a slow motion, thrown in or out of action by a cam, and detachable at will.  It was tried in 1914 and unanimously approved of.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe multiplied troubles of the radio operator on board ship, and persistent complaints to the superintendent, have hurried the development of the break-key.  The name was a misfit for early devices with their multitude of levers, wires and contacts.  The delicacy of the equipment was responsible for periodic instruction from the company engineers not to tamper with the outfit.  /  The â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>,â€™ as it was disrespectfully called, sputtered and flashed at the contacts, and the noises circulating in the telephones further tried the patience of the operator.  Messages were received with uncertainty and traffic was frequently congested.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œTrucks Make Their Own Fuel.  The accompanying photographs, showing a method of generating fuel gas for motor vehicles from charcoal, which has been rather extensively tried out in France, illustrates, to our mind, a tendency which has been apparent in Europe since the World Warâ€“a tendency to attempt to accomplish by complicated methods what is already being accomplished through simple means.  [â€¦]  The apparatus consists of a generating chamber having a grate, firebox and boiler for producing the necessary steam for making the gas.  It appears to be an amazing complication of internal â€˜<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.â€™  The gas must be scrubbed, filtered to remove particles of charcoal, and further purified in a centrifugal purifier.  There are a number of other details which it seems unnecessary to mention here.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œYou know, of course, that the weak radio impulse that reaches your set by way of the antenna is amplified or strengthened many times before it is converted into the electrical equivalent of sound that you can hear.  This strengthening of the radio signal is accomplished by passing it through several circuits, each of which consists, essentially, of a vacuum tube, a coil of wire, and a queer-looking metal <span class="red">gadget</span> with two sets of metal fins, called a condenser.  You have noticed how some of these fins slide in between others without actually coming into contact, when you turn the knob that tunes the stations.  Moving these fins, or condenser plates, governs the tuning of the individual stage of amplification.  The same result could be obtained by changing the number of turns in the coil of wire, but it is mechanically more convenient to do the tuning by moving the condenser plates.â€

Whether used for a narrative summary of a news event, or for the intricate analysis of a biographical study, its charm attracts and holds the reader.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThere was talk of a mechanical <span class="red">gadget</span> to delay announcers words after they had entered the microphone long enough for a copy-desk of â€˜editorsâ€™ to delete objectionable phrases. Most of the editorial comment was in a similar jocular vein, and did Ted no real harm.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œLetâ€™s now pass down under the camera, to finish our new inspection. Here, we find the tripod socket. What more prosaic and uninspired <span class="red">gadget</span> than this? Yet, this unobtrusive little threaded recess is one of the most important aids to good pictures. What a pity it is so little used!â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe â€œStukaâ€™sâ€ deflector fork is the bomb rack <span class="red">gadget</span> which lowers the 1100- or 550-pound bomb so that it will clear the arc of the propeller blades when released. The bomb is carried snuggled up against the center section of the wing to diminish air resistance. When the pilot makes ready to dive, the rack is extended.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œNeat little <span class="red">gadget</span> for mounting a diagonal in a Newtonian reflector is shown in Figure 5, which is selfÂ­ explanatory (â€œHua-i neng ta châ€™ien yen,â€ or, pictureâ€™s meaning can exÂ­ press a thousand words, in case your Chinese has become rusty). Developed by Max Burgdorf, Natchitoches, Louisiana, and made by Lorane BritÂ­tain and Sherwood Burgdorf, it takes the place of the more customary spider support for diagonals and would cause a less complicated diffraction pattern than the latter.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œIf   the  sound  presented  was  the â€œwrongâ€  one, she was supposed to remain in this position.  If it was the right one, she was to knock on the lid of a switch box in front of her cage with her trunk:  this caused an electrical <span class="red">gadget</span> to bring a food  reward within reach of her trunk.  The experimenter sat behind a screen watching the animal by means of a mirror system.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œA  case  history  of a  schizophrenic  child  who  converted  himself into  a  â€œmachineâ€  because  he  did  not  dare  be  human.  His  story sheds  light  on  emotional  development  in  a  mechanized  society.  [â€¦]  To counteract this fear we gave him a metal wastebasket in lieu of a toilet.  Eventually, when eliminating into the wastebasket, he no longer needed to take off all his clothes, nor to hold on to the wall.  He still needed the tubes and motors which, he believed, moved his bowels for him.  But here again the all-important machinery was itself a source of new terrors.  In Joeyâ€™s world the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> had to move their bowels, too.  He was terribly concerned that they should, but since they were so much more powerful than men, he was also terrified that if his tubes moved their bowels, their feces would fill all of space and leave no room to live.  He was thus always caught in some fearful contradiction.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œCreators of intelligent artificial brains, said Williams, should strive for machines that are designed and built specially for abstract thinking. The necessary hardware will soon be available: electronic units, analogous to brain cells, that can be produced by the billion, be made too small to see with a microscope, send 100 million signals per second, never make mistakes and last indefinitely. Computers made of these wonderful <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and geared for abstract thought should be able to outthink the brightest human brain.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œâ€ We work by remote control, just like they do at the AEC.

Using these I can do anything I could in person with the difference that thereâ€™s a quarter inch of glass between me and my work. I have controls that let me use magnifiers, and even do microdissection, if necessary. â€œâ€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe electronic <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> so vital to vehicles in far-out space suffer from some far-out troubles. Cosmic radiation sickens their semiconductors. Vibrations and swift temperature changes cause fractures in all-important wires. Lubricants evaporate into the vacuum of space. But scientists are already working on some far-out cures. The latest: a tin-magnesium-aluminum alloy that can be made into wires that grow gap-bridging â€œ whiskers â€œ when broken and soon heal their own wounds.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œAn oscillator  is an essential element of  apparatus  as  diverse  as  pendulum clocks,  jackhammers,  radios,  lasers,  hyÂ­draulic  rams  and  electronic  heart  paceÂ­makers.  For  every  kind  of oscillator  that has  been  put  to  work  at  least  a  dozen other  kinds  repose  on  laboratory  shelves as  interesting but useless  <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  Three new  examples  of  such <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span>  recently came to the attention of this department. The  first of the  three,  which  is  known  as a  salt  oscillator,  is  the  creation  of  Seelye Martin  of  the University of  Washington.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œFirst I thought I was going to be sick, and then I thought I was going to die. Then I thought I was sick and dead both. Along the side of big roads you sometimes find a billboardpainted on something like a Venetian blind so that when the slats are tilted one way, there is one picture, and then, when by some inner <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> the slats are tilted the other way, there gradually appears another picture, and that is how it happened there in Brownieâ€™s kitchen. First I was looking at one thing, then I was looking at another.â€
