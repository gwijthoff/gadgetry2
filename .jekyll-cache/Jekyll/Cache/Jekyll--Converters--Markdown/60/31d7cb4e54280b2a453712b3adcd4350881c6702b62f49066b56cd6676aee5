  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œFurther, at Cape Evans there had been running for more than three months a scientific station, which rivaled in thoroughness and exactitude any other such station in the world.  I hope that later a more detailed account may be given of this continuous series of observations, some of them demanding the most complex mechanism, and all of the watched over by enthusiastic experts.  It must here suffice to say that we who on our return saw for the first time the hut and its annexes completely equipped were amazed; though perhaps the <span class="red">gadget</span> which appealed most to us at first was the electric apparatus by which the cook, whose invention it was, controlled the rising of his excellent bread.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œA Handy <span class="red">Gadget</span> for the Magazine Subscriber.  How do you remove the wrappers from tightly rolled newspapers or magazines?  [â€¦]  The problem has been solved by a cutter devised by Arthur F. Hoffman, a rural mail carrier at Harvard, Neb., recently submitted to the Post Office Department and approved by the Postal authorities.  The cutter is in the form of a knife with a curved and flattened tip.  The flat point is easily inserted underneath the wrapper and a forward movement of the instrument results in clean cutting of the covering without damage to the contents.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œlagging one night at a dinner party in Paris some three years ago, Mr. Alexander Calder amused his table companion by making a chicken out of a piece of bread and a hairpin. A success story has grown from that idle bit of modelling. Mr. Calderâ€™s kangaroo is now one of the heaviest-selling <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> in the Christmas toy lists; his bear, bull, and dog are also popular numbers. He has also had an enormous succor dâ€™estime with a wire, felt, and heaver-hoard circus. These raw materials he took up when he abandoned bread and hairpins. The Calder circus is in town now. You canâ€™t buy tickets to it, but people who have seen it say it is worth getting a bid to a private showing.â€

It consisted of a selenium cell on one side of the chimney, and an electric bulb on the other. And when the next rain fell the young Cal Tech man did not have to go out and get wet, for the smoke would cut off the light and thus operate the galvanometer hooked to the cell, ringing a bell when the smoke would appear. The apparatus was so good that it is still in use in the chimney after all these years. / The young college student was Frank Capra . . . â€œ

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œAn ingenious contraption called a â€œThrill- O-Meterâ€ was used for advance publicity on â€œRue Morgueâ€ by C. E. Oâ€™Donnell, manager of the Paramount Theatre, Baton Rouge, La. This thrill-o-meter was constructed by- building a lobby cut-out and using the figure of a gorilla. The display was arranged so that its base covered the lobby scales. Then under the scales platform, a water bag was placed, filled with colored liquid. The hot water bag was attached to a glass indicator tube which ran up the center of the cut-out. At various levels on the indicator, small cards were placed with copy such as : 200-220. .. .You like to be thrilled! 160-180. .. .We advise you to be accom- panied by an escort! 120-140 Its thrills will chill you! Wear an overcoat ! 80-100. . . .You have an average heart and can stand the supreme thrills in â€œMurders in the Rue Morgue !â€ 40- 60â€¦. Donâ€™t enter unless accompanied by a friend ! - 20. . . .Youâ€™re too young to see this pic- ture without your parents ! We believe the above description will en- able the average person to construct a simi- lar <span class="red">gadget</span>, if the spirit so prompts him, and we are indebted to Oâ€™Donnell for passing along the information.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe question is frequently asked whether it is not cheaper to buy oneâ€™s photographic accessories than  to build them.  Such a statement cannot be answered with a blanket reply of â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜noâ€™ because several factors are involved.  What, for instance, is meant by expense?  Money or time?  From the dollars and cents viewpoint, it may be cheaper to â€˜make it yourselfâ€™ but it will, of course, involve timeâ€“in some cases, a great deal of time.  It is taken for granted, of course, that the home-made article will be made so well that it will work as effectively as the purchased one.  /  Another point to consider is the â€˜makeupâ€™ of the builder himself.  There are some self-sufficient people, sometimes known as the â€˜handy-manâ€™ type, who will never buy an article that they can possibly make themselves.  With such persons, the expense of time will be offset by the satisfaction derived from making the desired <span class="red">gadget</span>.  /  Then there is the factor of whether the accessory in question is available on the market.  Certain photographic problems are so peculiar and unusual that nothing remains for the worker to do but to make the required tool himself or to go without it.â€

A kitchen rack arose, with hooks for pots and pans and space for plates and eating utensils.  A â€˜cup treeâ€™ spread out its arms.  Over in that corner (I am pointing SW now) we dug an underground refrigerator.  And in the other direction was the covered garbage hole and the grease trap, which consisted of a small pit with a wicker cover.  On the cover we piled a couple of handfulls of dry grass to absorb the grease from the messy water poured through it.  The grass we renewed daily, burning the old lot.  [â€¦]  All this was the work of the first couple of days in camp, but the <span class="red">gadget</span> idea went on.  We moved forward under the battle cry, â€˜Letâ€™s have another <span class="red">gadget</span>!â€™ and the further result was a camp broom, fire tongs, rustic broilers, a hot-plate holder, pot hooks, a serving table, shoe racks, a bulletin board, and even a primitive mail box before the ten days were up. [â€¦]  How many of that type of <span class="red">gadget</span> shall we be seeing in your camp this summer?â€

It came out of the sweat and toil and practical experience of hundreds of enthusiastic photographers whose nimble wits have devised thse clever mechanical means for overcoming some of their many difficulties that stand between them and the attainment of their goal.  â€¦  Photography is a many-sided hobby.  Among other diversions, it provides those of its devotees who like to tinker with tools a never ending incentive to make devices for which they have immediate and very practical use.  They ahve the fun of making things whose utility amply justifies the time and inexpensive materials required.  â€¦  It is not the purpose of most of these ingenious <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> to take trade away from the photographic manufacturer.  Commercial products cannot usually be duplicated in the home workshop at anything like the cost of the manufactured article.  But here are many items not regularly marketed.  They would probably not have sufficient sale to warrant their manufacture, although many of them will prove invaluable to workers faced with problems similar to those of the writers.  We are confident that no one seriously engaged in photography, especially under makeshift conditions in the home where so much enthusiastic work is done, can fail to find in this book many hints which will save him not only an appreciable amount of time and money, but also much vexation of spirit.â€

All the machining was done on a wood-working lathe and drill press in the pattern shop here at The California Institute of Technology. Figure 5 is a photograph of anÂ­ other spherical globe sun-clock made earlier and partly similar.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œItâ€™s a lot of fun, as any amateur telescope maker will tell you, to invent, design, and then build <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> to save labor, even if the actual labor saving is minus quantity.  You get your pay when you can step aside and watch them function automatically, with a self-satisfied grin on your face.  Who cares about time, anyway.  /  Top-flight position as Public <span class="red">Gadget</span>eer No. 1 undoubtedly has now been won by Kenneth Richter, 33 Clarence Ave., Bridgewater, Mass, whose star camera works while he sleeps.  It is in storage just now, as Richter is away at Harvard and in summer is running a â€œChromocinemataudiographic Expedition, Ltd.â€™ (possibly â€˜limitedâ€™ refers to the funds) somewhere between hudson Bay and the N. Pole.  Nevertheless we invited him to remove the bushel from off its light, so the rest of us could see its glimmer.  /  â€œThe desire for the instrument was born of the fact that we have but two seasons in Bridgewater-the cold seaÂ­ son and the mosquito season, and both are too uncomfortable for visual guiding of an astronomical camera. ThereÂ­fore, about a yearâ€™s work was spent overcoming the discomfort of attendÂ­ ing the camera throughout the nightÂ­ the exposure is made automatically.  /  At about dark, I go out, lift the cover off the instrument, and pull out the plate holder slide against a stop. Next, I go in and set a clock by my bedside for the time I want the exposure to start, also for the length of time it is to run. Then I work on a mirror, take the girl friend to a movie (though building the thing kept me so broke that this is just wishful thinking) or I go to bed.  /  At, say, 2 A.M., the clock turns on the power.  Outside, the camera springs to life. A small motor swings the flap shutter open, and an electroÂ­ magnet holds it thereafter when the small motor has shut itself off by breaking its own circuit just as the shutter strikes the magnet. The latter is energized by a radio â€˜Aâ€™ eliminator, to avoid the vibration of the camera that would result from the use of an A.C. magnet. This is a satisÂ­ factory source of 6-v., D.C., well filtered. Meanwhile a synchronous motor drive, using one of the henâ€™s-teeth 4-watt Warren motors, has started to apply the diurnal motion.  [â€¦]  While almost all the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are simple enough to be foolproof in operation, the drive frequently messes up the work.  Other than that, one might say that it saves me probably 2 hoursâ€™ work a week.  The number of hours required to build the machine would, of course, swallow up this saving for several years.  However, I donâ€™t even try to justify it as a net, over-all time saver.  It isnâ€™t.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œâ€œThese are the preliminary adjustments. When these are complete, I should start collimating from both ends, and meet in the middle. Insert the main mirror and line up so that the optical axis coincides with the cross-wires. Insert accurate cross-wires at the inner end of the declinaÂ­tion axis (c, Figure 1). A cap should be provided for the eyepiece adapter tube, with a small hole in the exact center. Such a cap can easily be made of tin, and is a very useful <span class="red">gadget</span>.â€  [â€¦]  Again, all this is largely of general interest, alone, to the average amateur, because the necessary furnace is seldom available.  Gemmill states that homemade blower could be rigged up with an oil burner and some sort of retort.  Again we have the intangible factor of fun pottering with <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, and when some too practical-minded critic comes along to remark, â€˜Does it pay?â€™ you say â€˜No,â€™â€“and go on pottering, leaving him shaking his head.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œProblemâ€“â€“<span class="red">Gadget</span>â€“â€“Solution!â€  â€œWe hope you enjoy this display of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  They were developed by workers who wanted to attain better efficiency or greater safety on their jobs.  Perhaps you have a <span class="red">gadget</span> that would be interesting to your own company.  If so, your management may be willing to consider its possible inclusion in this show so others may share its benefits.â€  â€œMechanical ingenuity is typical of the American worker.  From the cotton gin to the can opener he has used his inventiveness to create devices that do things more efficiently, more easily, more safely or at lower cost.  /  In an effort to further simulate such ingenuity, and also to assist in the exchange of ideas of this type, we are presenting this collection of â€˜<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.â€™  /  For the most part, they are not commercially available but have been made up by the machine shops of the plants involved.  A few however have been in such demand that independent manufacturers were requested to produce and market them.  /  The Du Pont Chambers Works Safety Section and the Du Pont Wilmington Safety and Fire Protection Division were instrumental in making this collection possible.â€  â€œ

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œAs I returned to the study MIss Dukas explained to me that Eric Rogers, who teaches physics at Princeton, had made a <span class="red">gadget</span> for Einstein as a present for his 76th birthday, and that Professor Einstein had been delighted with it.  Back in  the  study,  I  saw  Einstein  take  from the  corner  of  the  room what  looked  like a  curtain  rod  five  feet  tall,  at  the  top  of which  was  a  plastic  sphere about  four inches  in diameter. Coming  up  from  the rod  into  the  sphere  was  a  small  plastic tube  about  two  inches  long,  terminating in  the  center  of  the  sphere.  Out  of  this tube there came a string with a little ball at  the  end.  â€œYou  see,â€  said  Einstein, â€œthis  is  designed  as  a  model  to  illustrate the  equivalence  principle. The  little  ball is  attached  to  a  string,  which  goes  into the  little  tube  in  the  center  and  is  atÂ­tached  to  a  spring.  The  spring  pulls  on the  ball,  but   it  cannot  pull the ball up and  into  the  little  tube  because  the spring  is  not  strong  enough  to  overcome the  gravitational  force which pulls down on the ball.â€ A  big  grin  spread  across his face  and  his  eyes  twinkled  with  delight as  he  said:  â€œAnd  now  the  equivalence principle.â€  Grasping  the  <span class="red">gadget</span>  in  the middle  of  the  long  brass  curtain  rod,  he thrust it upward until the sphere touched the  ceiling.  â€œNow  I  will  let  it  drop,â€  he said,  â€œand  according  to  the  equivalence principle  there  will  be  no  gravitational force.  So  the  spring  will  now  be  strong enough  to  bring  the  little  ball  into  the plastic  tube.â€  With  that  he  suddenly  let the  <span class="red">gadget</span>  fall  freely  and  vertically, guiding it with his hand, until the bottom reached  the  floor.  The  plastic  sphere  at the  top  was  now  at  eye  level.  Sure enough, the ball nestled in the tube.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œSafety is one park aspect which can never be overdone, for the fight against accident causes is a continuing one.  Steeplechase, being quite an old operation, got started on its safety campaign many years ago.  â€¦  Many operators have come up with <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> to prevent ride mishaps and I will outline some of ours, first telling a Class A example of one which paid for itself nicely.  â€¦  The <span class="red">gadget</span> used here is the same in principal that we use on other rides.  That is, a three-inch pipe protrudes next to each wheel, so that if an axle breaks or a wheel is thrown, the car body merely settles a couple of inches onto the pipe, instead of falling thru to the ground.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œSome months ago I added a <span class="red">gadget</span> to the tunnel which considerably broadens its utility as a scientific tool.  This consists simply of an electric door bell (with the gong removed) and a chamber with a diaphragm inserted in the smoke circuit just ahead of the â€˜rake.â€™  When properly adjusted, the door-bell-and-diaphragm assembly acts as a chopper to send the smoke out into the tunnel in small puffs or pulses instead of in a continuous streamâ€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œKENNETH  D.  ROEDER  (â€œMoths and  Ultrasoundâ€)  is  professor  of  physiÂ­ology  at  Tufts  University,  where  he has  served  since  1931.  He  was  born in  England,  was  graduated  from  the University of Cambridge and did graduÂ­ate  work  there and at the University  of Toronto.  â€œMy  lifelong  interest  in  inÂ­sects,â€  he  writes,  â€œprobably  stems  from a  childhood  enthusiasm  for  butterfly collecting.â€  Roederâ€™s research deals mainly  with  the  biological  aspects  of insect behavior.  In addition he is â€œan incurable  tinkerer  with  mechanical  and electronic <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>,â€ an activity that â€œled at  one  time  to  the  construction  of  an electromechanical  analogue  of  certain phases  of  cockroach behavior  and  has played a part in the work on moth hearÂ­ing.â€  He  says he has â€œalways felt that if one can make a  subject  clear  and interÂ­esting  to  a  nonspecialist,  it  becomes clearer and more interesting to oneself.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œHowever, the third Alexander Calder demonstrated from his childhood an adventuresomeness and ingenuity that clearly marked him as no mere follower, even of his talented forebears.  Growing up in Arizona, California and New York, young â€˜â€˜Sandyâ€™ Calder tirelessly crafted playthings and other <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> out of wire, wood and nails. In 1919 he graduated as an engineer from the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., then set out on an eccentric progression of technical jobs. As a boilerman on a passenger liner, he devised a contraption to direct sea breezes into the stifling engine room.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œWe made a wooden platform for the tents to keep their floors dry and hold the tents straight â€“ the stakes had not held in the wet ground. Down at the river we made a trap that funneled fish into a wire cage, and from a simple roof and frame and some of the mosquito netting we built a mosquito-proof gazebo where we could congregate. These were <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, not inventions, but they made life more comfortable, and within very few days I could see the skeleton of a settlement in Jeronimo.â€
