  â€œSome months ago I added a <span class="red">gadget</span> to the tunnel which considerably broadens its utility as a scientific tool.  This consists simply of an electric door bell (with the gong removed) and a chamber with a diaphragm inserted in the smoke circuit just ahead of the â€˜rake.â€™  When properly adjusted, the door-bell-and-diaphragm assembly acts as a chopper to send the smoke out into the tunnel in small puffs or pulses instead of in a continuous streamâ€

  â€œThe first of the sciences to be placed on a modern footingâ€“â€“that of anatomyâ€“â€“ was one which the artists cultivated and which was governed by direct observation.  It was the artists who even set up the cry that one must not be satisfied to learn from the ancients or to take everything from books; one must examine nature for oneself.  The artists were often the engineers, the designers of fortifications, the inventors of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>; they were nearer to the artisan than were the scholars, and their studios often had the features of a laboratory or workshop.  [â€¦]  Science and craftsmanship, combined with the state of the market, enabled them, however, to indulge their zeal for <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, mechanical improvements and inventions.â€

  â€œThe situation is particularly alarming in view of the vested  interests  that already exist  with  respect  to  the  development and sale of privacy-invading devices and procedures.  Perhaps  even  more  alarmÂ­ing  are  two  attitudes  that,  it  seems  to me, underlie  the speed with which some of  the  privacy-invading  practices have taken  root, and  that  are  likely  to  be  the basis for a continuing demand for them. The first attitude can be characterized as an infatuation with <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and procedures that appear, at least to the layman, to be scientific.  This attitude seems to lead people to fit problems and objectives to the tools that happen to be available.  The second attitude, encouraged by an all too human desire to avoid personal responsibility for decisions is a preference for data and procedures that lend themselves to mechanization, in the belief that the elimination of human judgment is in itself desirable.  I am reminded here of what the late Norbert Wiener used to say (as far back as 1950) with regard to the use of computers.  He stressed that the greatest danger lies in our delegating to computers, out of ignorance or mental laziness, decisions that should remain ours.â€

  <strong>Matthews, Sondra, 1969.</strong>
  â€œDuring this time of patriotic feelings, the liberals insure the promise of pay-off from the chosen side, and they begin to send our sons, husbands, and other love ones to assist as a return on that job opportunity. / We look around at the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> we own for the first time, even if theyâ€™re not paid for, with a â€˜theyâ€™re mineâ€™ attitude, and we decide that there is no better place than America, and kiss the men good-by for God and HIS Country. / Six months later, our neighbor, our kin folk, and soon we find that our men will not return, a telegram comes telling theyâ€™re dead.â€

  â€œIn addition, Consumer Reports brings you a wide range of authoritativeâ€”sometimes startlingâ€”articles. You regularly receive candid, down-to-earth discussions of deceptive packaging practices (with examples cited by name), advertising claims, credit buying and the actual cost of credit . . . honest reports on vitamins and other drugs . . . revealing facts about new, highly promoted <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that are often a waste of money.â€

  <strong>Prestbo, John A., 1969.</strong>
  â€œThe latest executive nightmare, already spread to epidemic proportions, goes something like this: Widget &amp;; <span class="red">Gadget</span> Corp., dutifully complying with new Securities and Exchange Commission rules, breaks down its consolidated profit and reveals for the first time how much came from widgets and how much from <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, its two lines of business. It turns out that widgets are piling up profits like crazy, but <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are pretty sick.â€

  â€œGood God, of course! The Lancashire Witches. Sixteenâ€¦ thirty-something? Old Demdike, the head witch of the coven, her real name was Device. The whole damned family were witches. Oh, no. Donâ€™t tell me â€“ â€œ â€œ Oh, yes. â€œ Volz gave a hoarse shout of laughter, and one of the vile <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> caught the vibration and whispered rustily. | â€œ Our little lady is the last descendant of one of the most notorious families in the history of witchcraft. Funniest thing I ever heard of.â€

  â€œWithin a couple of years. computers will not only pinpoint crime target areas but also automatically assign patrols when and where they are needed, making possible what Reddin. calls â€œ instant cop? an officer at the scene of a call minutes after itâ€™s made. Hipped on technology, Reddin wants <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that will permit officers to see in the dark, frisk suspects without touching them, # | and halt speeding automobiles without firing a shot. In his conception of law enforcement, computerization and <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> are not ends in themselves but will free officers to get at the real task of policing: knowing the people.â€
