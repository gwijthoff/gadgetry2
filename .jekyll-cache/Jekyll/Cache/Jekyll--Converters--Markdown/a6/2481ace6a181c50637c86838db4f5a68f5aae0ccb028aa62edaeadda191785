Wozniak, meanwhile, had dropped out of Berkeley to become a designer at Hewlett-Packard. After hours, Wozniak worked hard building a small, easy-to-use computer. In 1976 he succeeded. The pint-size machine was smaller than a portable typewriter, but it could do the feats of much larger computers. # To Wozniak, the new machine was simply a <span class="red">gadget</span> to show his fellow computer buffs. Jobs, in contrast, saw the commercial potential of the machine that could help families do their personal finance or small businesses control inventories, and he urged that they form a company to market the computer.

  â€œIn the Surrey Papers of 1969 there were a variety of proposals to nibble at tax preferences, such as a proposal to allocate personal deductions between taxable and non-taxable income and a minimum tax. In one form or another <span class="red">gadget</span> proposals of this sort have played a major role in tax legislation in recent years. The legislative defenders of various tax preferences saw the slight retreat of being subject to a limitation in tax preferences or a minimum tax as a key defense against further reforms. It kept Surrey from talk ing about rich people who paid no tax due to intangible drilling expenses, gifts of appreciated property, etc.  â€¦ Up to 1984 the Surrey forecast in this area didnâ€™t look good. All that the mini mum did was spawn more complicated <span class="red">gadget</span> type tax reforms. Surreyâ€™s argument was, however, a long-run argument and in 1985 the long run just may have arrived with a Republican Treasury beat ing the drums for Surrey-type tax re forms.

  <strong>Douglas, Carole Nelson, 1988.</strong>
  â€œâ€ Of course you are. You know your self-hatred manifests itself in your drive to succeed in your career. And the more successful you are, the more you loathe yourself. And then you gorge â€“ secretly, in your chic, narrow esophagus of an alley kitchen with all those stainless steel <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>. â€œ Such things you gorge on, dear Monica, so tacky. Fish and chips, ice cream by the half gallon â€“ and not even ice cream from some SoHo specialty shop, but common supermarket lard. You make quite a pig of yourself, Monica, in that high-rent apartment of yours. And then you come to me. For absolution. â€œâ€

  â€œAn infinitesimal mechanical advantage can make the difference between a winning and a losing sled, and the snoops at Winterberg were hoping to catch a glimpse or a hint or a suggestion of a <span class="red">gadget</span> or an idea that an opposing team may have come up with since last season. It was a tense, watchful scene, worthy of a good suspense-filled cold war espionage movie. . . . Such was the superiority of the two supersled powers, that of the 18 medals awarded in the last three Olympics, 10 went to East Germany (including five of six golds) and five went to Switzerland. Two medals were won by West Germany and one by the U.S.S.R. // The international federation tried hard to halt this expensive technological race. But when it introduced new restrictions, Spezialtechnik would just come up with new <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that werenâ€™t outlawed, and the Swiss, working alone in their garages, kept souping up their machines in a similar manner.â€

  â€œThe tapes that prompted Richard Nixonâ€™s Watergate resignation in 1974 might never have existed had he not been such a klutz with <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>. Nixon was reluctant to have his conversations recorded, writes former Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman in Prologue, a National Archives publication. But if there had to be a taping system, the President said, he wanted something simple â€“ like Lyndon Johnsonâ€™s manually operated setup. # Haldeman was worried that his chief would forget to turn the gizmo on when he wanted it, or â€“ worse â€“ to turn it off when he didnâ€™t. Haldeman also fretted â€œ that this President was far too ineptâ€

  <strong>Free, John, 1988.</strong>
  â€œMost 3-D TV systems rely on simple binocular vision to create depth: When your eyes and brain see objects from slightly different perspectives, a sense of depth, called stereopsis, results. The first <span class="red">gadget</span> to exploit stereopsis, the mirror stereoscope, was invented in 1833 by Sir Charles Wheatstone. He created pairs of drawings, each slightly different from the other to simulate left- and right-eye views, to form a 3-D image when viewed through mirrors.â€

  â€œThis new <span class="red">gadget</span> facilitates computer use in the home. Itâ€™ s Spectrum AC (for alternating current), a new type of modem that allows data to be transmitted at high speed over the standard electrical wiring in homes. Computers and accessories wouldnâ€™ t need to have special cables connecting them, making it easier to move them between rooms without clumsy rewiring. NEC Corp. of Japan says the product will be available in the U.S. later this year, probably retailing below $300. Since at least two modems are needed. . .â€

To assess just how likely it was that good of Harlan Albright had decided to eliminate a possible threat, one would need to know just what it was that was being threatened.â€

  â€œThe list of â€œ indirect â€œ spinoffs from Project Apollo features one of the most revolutionary <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> of modern times: the home computer. Back in the late 1950s, the state-of-the-art computer was the size of a city block. The space program encouraged an extraordinary process of miniaturization that down-sized master computers. As it happened, the Eagleâ€™s 17-pound model was not equal to its task. But its development helped spark the personal-computer revolution.â€

  â€œRubber padding held on with rubber bands covered the camera body. A wire led to it. He stood on the stairs and examined it with his flashlight, then reached up and removed the camera, excess wire following along. The wire was connected to a <span class="red">gadget</span> on top with a small alligator clip. With the stairwell light off, he unclipped it and carried the camera to the kitchen table. Unwrapping the rubber padding with gloves on was difficult, so he took them off. The <span class="red">gadget</span> on top was some kind of an electromagnetic doohickey with a lever. When the current was turned on by flippingthe light switch, the magnet was energized and caused this steel pin to push the camera shutter button, tripping the shutter. When the current ceased, a spring reset the lever, which released the shutter button and allowed the film to be automatically advancedby the camera.â€
