  â€œI think that many an officer, when he first studies the mooring board at the Naval Academy, or rather when he is supposed to study it, is at once impressed with its resemblance to a huge spider web, contrived by the devilish ingenuity of man for the purpose of hopelessly enmeshing the poor flyâ€“which is himself.  [â€¦]  In either case, if the ship has to shift berth, the tendency is to damn the mooring board as an impracticable â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>,â€™ and to fail to criticize the manner of its use.  Thus when it comes to a consideration of the less obvious manuvering problems, he is prone to dismiss the whole matter with the assertion tha, like the Peace of God, it â€˜passeth all understanding.â€™  [â€¦]  When speaking of mooring board problems, I think not so much of the board itself as of the kind of work involved.  Such problems may be worked out on the actual board, or in many cases on a chart, or perhaps on some kind of specially contrived â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>.â€™ [â€¦]  I have a <span class="red">gadget</span> I use for maneuvering problems instead of the printed forms, locally known as the â€˜Wegee Board,â€™ because it is supposed to predict the future and explain the past.  It is a sheet of white celluloid with an 18â€circle on it graduated in degrees.  At the center is the point of a thumb tack inserted from the bottom side and filed down till it barely projects above the board.â€

  â€œFinally, there is the â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>,â€™ which is employed when insufficient fall [gravitational momentum] is available, in order to push the packages along.â€  (209)  â€œThe â€˜<span class="red">Gadget</span>.â€™ â€“ A â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>â€™ is illustrated in Figs. 302 to 304 (Rownson, Drew, &amp; Clydesdaleâ€™s patent).  This device comes into play principally when a sufficient gradient for a gravity runway is unobtainable, and where, therefore, a very slight incline or even a level path, has to be chosen.  A â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>â€™ may likewise be used for an uphill gradient for stacking purposes (see Fig. 305), or it may take the place of a â€˜humperâ€™; generally speaking, a â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>â€™ will push a steady stream of cases for about 200 ft. on a level path.  This device is made 8 ft. long in order that it may replace an 8-ft. section of a runway without necessitiating any rearrangement of the rest of the lay-out.  The machine consists of an angle frame which may stand on a level floor in case of a stationary installation, or may be mounted on wheels for a portable lay-out; it totally elcloses the elctro-motor and the propelling device.  [â€¦]  It would not be practicable for the â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>â€™ to push cases round the corner; the path must always be in a straight line.  If angles have to be negotiated, this must be done on a gravity run after the cases leave, independently of the pushing influence of the â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>.â€™â€

  â€œSomebody has suggested that the installation of thermostats, shutters, etc., is a confession of weakness; that a properly designed cooling plant ought to cool the car without the necessity for tinkering with it to meet the vagaries of the weather.  The fact is, of course, that overcooling is just as objectionable as constant boiling; and that the only way in which a proper mean can be maintained is by a system that modifies its cooling capacity according to the weather.  At the same time, the thing can be carried to an unnecessary degree of fineness.

  â€œThe famous Handley Page slotted wing, shown diagrammatically in our sketch, when open actually increases the maximum lift between fifty and seventy percent!  Its incorporation involves many mechanical difficulties, and aeronautical engineers always like to leave their wings free of all â€˜<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>â€™ or complications.  Nevertheless, this tremendous increase in lift may very well be utilized one day either to diminish landing speeds or to increase the carrying capacity of our planes.â€

  â€œTrucks Make Their Own Fuel.  The accompanying photographs, showing a method of generating fuel gas for motor vehicles from charcoal, which has been rather extensively tried out in France, illustrates, to our mind, a tendency which has been apparent in Europe since the World Warâ€“a tendency to attempt to accomplish by complicated methods what is already being accomplished through simple means.  [â€¦]  The apparatus consists of a generating chamber having a grate, firebox and boiler for producing the necessary steam for making the gas.  It appears to be an amazing complication of internal â€˜<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.â€™  The gas must be scrubbed, filtered to remove particles of charcoal, and further purified in a centrifugal purifier.  There are a number of other details which it seems unnecessary to mention here.â€

  â€œA College Professor Solves a Mathematical Problem and Becomes a Wealthy Inventor.

He never thought of himself as an inventor, never looked for anything to invent, never had any intention of making a lot of money, believes he is weak in imagination-that quality so often considered necessary to successÂ­ful invention-has put in far more time writing a book than he has done in inventing, has done his inÂ­ venting only as a sort of side line and never bothered pedÂ­dling an invention around among manufacturers. All the inventing he does is with a pen and a note book. And yet Louis Alan Hazeltine has made a fortune out of his inventions.

  â€œAn Industrial Expert Tells Why Manufacturers Must Seek New Inventions to Keep Their Wheels Turning.  [â€¦]  â€œâ€˜Our experience with inventors and with manufacturers indicates that there is a tremendous amount of inventive effort going to waste.  A great deal of free-lance inventing means that the poor inventor spends a vast amount of time and thought and often hard-earned savings working up some useless <span class="red">gadget</span> that nobody will have.  â€œThe inventor must realize that the first requisite of any new invention is that there be a possibility of broad human need underlying it, and maÂ­ chinery for its distribution that can be made to turn without spending a small fortune.        Let him remember the really outstanding inventions and think of them not as mechanical creations but as things that made it possible for humanity to ride where it had walked; to bridge space with conversation where it formerly required days to transmit messages.  /  Let him remember Gilletteâ€™s safety razor. The money on this invention has been made not through the razor but the blades.  /  Gilletteâ€™s fundaÂ­mental idea from which that invention sprung was that he wanted to get something for which there would be unÂ­ limited repeat business. His hitting upon a blade that could be used and thrown away was a real stroke of genius.  /  This element of need is the thing that has been fundamental in inventions which have won commercial success.  Before he spends a lot of time, therefore, let the inventor check up on the potential market.â€

  â€œYou know, of course, that the weak radio impulse that reaches your set by way of the antenna is amplified or strengthened many times before it is converted into the electrical equivalent of sound that you can hear.  This strengthening of the radio signal is accomplished by passing it through several circuits, each of which consists, essentially, of a vacuum tube, a coil of wire, and a queer-looking metal <span class="red">gadget</span> with two sets of metal fins, called a condenser.  You have noticed how some of these fins slide in between others without actually coming into contact, when you turn the knob that tunes the stations.  Moving these fins, or condenser plates, governs the tuning of the individual stage of amplification.  The same result could be obtained by changing the number of turns in the coil of wire, but it is mechanically more convenient to do the tuning by moving the condenser plates.â€
