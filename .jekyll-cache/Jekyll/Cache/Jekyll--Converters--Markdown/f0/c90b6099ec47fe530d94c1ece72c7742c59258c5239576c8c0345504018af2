  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œan appliance to clean the bottom of the ship, without the necessity of dry-docking or employment of drivers.  It consists of an oblong structure armed with wire brushes, and looks very much like a door-mat.  This is pulled forwards and backwards by stout hawsers, made fast to the shipâ€™s steam capstans.  It can be made to traverse any path the operator requires.  The bristles of the brushes are magnetised, so that they both attract themselves to the iron of the shipâ€™s side and scrape as well.â€  /  â€œIt was wonderful to see how quickly the news spread round the ship that the electric scrubbing <span class="red">gadget</span> was worried satisfactorily.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œâ€œI appreciate the compliment,â€ began Sir William, â€œthat he implies to my device, but, as a matter of fact, I hardly think the apparatus is sufficiently perfect yetâ€”â€”â€ / The Lieutenant-Commander laughed rather brutally. â€œHe isnâ€™t paying compliments. He went on to say he didnâ€™t want the assistance ofâ€”erâ€”new inventions to bag a Fritz once heâ€™s sighted him.â€ / The First Lieutenant came quickly to the rescue. â€œOf course,â€ he said, â€œthatâ€™s all rot. Weâ€™re only too grateful toâ€”to Science for trying to invent a new <span class="red">gadget</span>â€¦.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œLook for another match!â€™  I cried to Davis, and although he knew he had no more, he began to throw things out of his pockets right and left.  Among these things there fell a smudge cigarette lighter.  These instruments were devised by the French on account of their extreme shortage of matches.  The <span class="red">gadget</span> consists of a tiny steel wheel, which strikes a piece of flint, which in turn ignites the smudge.  The only trouble with these things is that they do not always work.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œWhat do you think pleases my guests the most?â€™ Lewis asked.  After my tour of bewildering wonders I hesitated.  The engineer smiled and pointed to a shiny metal <span class="red">gadget</span> on the wall.  â€˜That little twenty-five-cent bottle opener and corkscrew, combined, makes more of a hit, if youâ€™ll believe it, than some of our most ambitious engineering schemes.  They think itâ€™s wonderful, and ask where they can buy one like it or whether they can have an extra one as a souvenir.  Thatâ€™s human nature, I guess.  The average man, when he turns on a light or opens a radiator valve, doesnâ€™t think of the power plant below that supplies him light and heat.  Thereâ€™s far more to running a hotel than one ever sees in a guest room.â€™â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œpuckered from the salt. Nowadays nobody pops corn. Report has it that in New York City there are not more than ten or twelve popcorn stands. Any lover of the delicacy who can, offhand, think of more than two is lucky. Even at Coney Island, where the popcorn trade should be brisk, one can walk the length of the Boardwalk without seeing a stand. Perhaps modern invention has made the pioneer delight of eating popcorn seem an anachronism. At any rate, there is not the old joy in corn popped in a little electrical <span class="red">gadget</span> that there used to be in the delicious stuff that was energetically shaken in a frying pan over a redhot stove. A German techni cian sees a city as Breathing a great organism of a constantly inhaling Metropolis. and exhaling vast breaths up and down in the atmosphere. In Berlin, he estimates, the breathing of human beings and animals and the exhausts of automobiles and chimneys produces at least 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide a day. Trees and other living plants absorb only a small fraction of the gasâ€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œ[The Food and Drugs Act] defines a drug as an agent used in the treatment of disease. Freckles, excess hair, wrinkles, enlarged pores, falling hair, obesity, and dandruff are not disÂ­ eases; they may be blemishes or botherations, but they no more classify as diseases than do irregularly architectures noses and shortness of stature. Hence cosmetics are not drugs, unless they make some specific claim to cute disease on their labels-which, generally speaking, they never do.  Cosmetics are surely not foods.  <span class="red">Gadget</span>s to straighten noses are not drugs, and neither are mechanical chiropractors intended to stretch the short men to great height so that they may avoid the failures and humiliations those of small stature (like Napoleon) undergo.  /  Therefore the present Food and Drugs Act does not cover cosmetics. It does not cover therapeutic <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and contraptions, some of them selling for 10 dollars and costing 75 cents to make, and all of them as astonishingly magical in their claimed powers as the miraculous necklace some firm got out to cure goiter.  [â€¦]  In . consequence of these deficiencies which have made Dr. Harvey W. Wileyâ€™s Food and Drugs Act obsolete, a revision of that act has been prepared to supersede the old statute. It was written by legal and scientific experts in the Department of Agriculture, gained the blessing of the Administration, and was introduced in the Senate by Senator Copeland in June 1933 as S. 1944.  That bill does specifically cover cosmetics. It covers <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and contrivances. It covers advertising, applying the same standard of accuracy to it that the present law applies to food and drug labels. It sets up food standards and it establishes minimum tolerances for the poison conÂ­ tent of foods.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œTherefore, I reasoned, no normal person can lie without increasing his blood pressure. This reasoning proved sound. Every time a subject lied, his systolic blood pressure went up. The more important the lie, the greater the mental effort and the greater the rise in blood pressure. I published the systolic blood pressure test for deception in rgy. Immediately the newspapers dubbed it the â€œ Lie Detector â€œ and referred to it as a mysterious apparatus. Actually the Lie Detector uses standard types of the sphygmomanometer - that little <span class="red">gadget</span> which doctors wrap around your arm just above the elbow to take your blood pressure - to reveal the added mental effort used in lying.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œFirst U. S. patent on a writing-machine, however, was issued in 1829 to a remarkable man named William Austin Burt. On this device, in March 1830, Inventor Burt whacked out the first letter typewritten in the U.S. Last week the Smithsonian Institution proudly announced that it had acquired and would shortly display this message. # Inventor Burtâ€™s machine, made entirely of wood, was destroyed in the Patent Office fire of 1836. It was a ponderous <span class="red">gadget</span> with the type carried on a circular frame operated by a lever. That Burt could write faster with his machine than by hand is highly improbable. Yet it had a feature that was lacking in some commercial machines for many years: separate sets of capital and lower-case letters, with a shift mechanism for changing from one to the other. # Descended from a family of early Massachusetts settlers, William Austin Burt was a surveyor, mechanic and millwright.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œTired of lacing up his boots, a Chicagoan named W. L, Judson in 1893 devised the worldâ€™s first slide fastener. It worked badly, but it made an instantaneous impression upon Colonel Lewis Walker, a lawyer from Meadville, Pa. Colonel Walker spent the next 20 years and about $1,000,000 collected from a multitude of sources, before he began to achieve any commercial success with the <span class="red">gadget</span>. Judson was unable to perfect it and it was not until 1913 that one Gideon Sundback developed the â€œ zipper â€œ as everyone now knows it. Started that year in a $300-a-year shack in Meadville, Hookless Fastener Co., maker of â€œ Talon â€œ fasteners, immediately went to town, is now the biggest of 16-odd U. S. zipper makers.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œSimilarly a romancer who had a cynical turn might foreshadow the collapse of Wester civilization, and call it The Triumph of the <span class="red">Gadget</span>.  In all probability the emergence of the <span class="red">gadget</span> has had a vast deal to do with the degenerative process.  During the last fifty years there has been invented almost every conceivable labor-saving device, with the consequence that the average man is in a state of utter manual incompetence.  This is well-known and is often commented upon.  But what is not so often observed in that these <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are not only labor-saving but brain-saving, thought-saving; and it seems an inescapable conclusion that a correlative mental incompetence is being induced.  /  A certain amount of resistance seems necessary for the proper functioning of mental and moral attributes, as it is for that of physical attributes.  In any of these three departments of life, if you can get results without effort, and habitually do so, the capacity for making the effort dwindles.  Whatever takes away the opportunity for effort, whatever obviates or reduces the need for making it, is therefore to some degree deleterious.  It needs a bit of brains to manage a furnace-fire successfully; an automatic heater needs none; hence many householders today could not manage a furnace-fire to save their livesâ€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œNapoleon decorated Joseph Marie Jacquard for his invention of Jacquard cards, those perforated little pieces of paper that control looms in such a way as to make them weave predetermined designs repetitiously. Now produced by automatic machinery, these cards are still expensive. Inasmuch as a separate card is needed for each thread of weft, a mere 10-inch design may require 800 cards which cost a little more than $100.00 to make. Not so with the Lefler robot. The cost has plummeted to $5.00. With this surprisingly simple <span class="red">gadget</span>, the most intricate designs may be faithfully duplicated. Merely writing oneâ€™s name on a copper plate is sufficient to initiate an action that eventuates in the appearance of // that name woven into cloth with every shade and inflection perfectly preserved. A delicate electric finger plays over the inked copper master and delivers an electronically-amplified current to a series of small electromagnets each of which controls a needle of the loom.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œWhat an odd little word â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>â€™ is, almost a <span class="red">gadget</span> in itself, so small and useful.  Its origin is obscure and is believed not to appear in print before 1886.  Yet it is not, as might be though, an Americanism.  It appears as an expression used chiefly by seamen, meaning any small tool, contrivance, or piece of mechanism not dignified by any specific name; a what-not, in fact; a chicken-fixing, a gill-guy, a timmey-noggy, a wim-wom.  I commend these agreeable synonyms to Mr. Clarence Elliottâ€™s notice, and at the same time record my gratitude for his revival of that other sea-0faring word, manavlins.  I wonder how many English-speaking people are familiar with its meaning?â€ (197).    â€œI mistrust <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, generally speaking.  They seldom work.  The proved, old-fashioned tool is usually better and it is safer to stick to it.  I thus make a rule of throwing all tempting catalogues of gardening <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> straight into the waste-paper basket, not daring to examine them first, because I know that if I examine them I shall fall.  It will mean only that I shall with some trouble obtain a postal order for 10s. 6d., to acquire an object which will speedily join similar objects rusting in the tool shed.  It should be clear from this that my mistrust of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is equalled only by my weakness for them, and that no amount of experience can make me find them anything but irresistibleâ€ (196).  Among her favorite <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>:  â€œThen there is the long narrow trowel of stainless steel and it s associate the two-pronged hand fork, both unrivaled for weeding in between small plants, though perhaps there is no tool so well adapted for this purpose as the old table knife with the stump of a broken plaid.â€ (196)  But the â€œperfect <span class="red">gadget</span>â€ is the â€œwidgerâ€ â€“ â€œthe neatest, slimmest, and cheapest of all <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> to carry in the pocket.  Officially the widget is Patent No. 828793, but it owes (I believe) its more personal name to the ingenuity of Mr. Clarence Elliott, whose racy gardening style ought to be more widely appreciated.  He invented the widger, its name, and the verb to wig, which, although not exactly onomatopoeic, suggests very successfully the action of prising upâ€“you wig up a weed, or wig up a caked bit of soil for the purpose of aerating itâ€“all very necessary operations which before the arrival of the widget were sometimes awkward to perform.  This small sleek object, four inches long, slides into the pocket, no more cumbersome than a pencil, and may be put to many uses.  Screwdriver, toothpick, letter-opener, widger, it fulfils [sic] all functions throughout the day.  Its creator, Mr. Elliot, I observe, spells it sometimes with a â€˜yâ€™: wydger, no doubt on the analogy of Blakeâ€™s Tyger, just to make it seem more unusual.  Whatever the spelling, it is the perfect <span class="red">gadget</span>â€ (197).  Next chapter, â€œTool-shedâ€:  â€œDifferent from <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are the time-honored tools which hang in the dusty brown twilight of the tool-shed when their dayâ€™s work is done.  The wood of their handles is as tawny as the arms of men who use them: the have a sun-burnt air.  The steel of spuds, forks, and trowels glistens quietly as though it were resting; it has been in contact with the earth all day, and recalls the old expedient of plunging a dirty knife-blade into the soil and withdrawing it restored to a brightness like the flash of Excalibur.  The prongs of forks are burnished as bayonets, the curve of hooks gleaming as sabers.  The big wooden trudges repose peacefully across the handles of the barrow.  The long handles of rakes and hoes dangle in rows, symmetrical as Uccelloâ€™s lances.  There is a shelf with all the odd accumulation of labels, green string, hedging-gloves, old tobacco tins full of saved seeds.  A hank of yellow bass hangs from a nail, blond as corn.  The flower-pots are piled, tier upon tier, red as a robinâ€™s breast.  Red and brown, green and golden, steely as armor, dusty as snuff, the tool-shed deepens in shadow as the respite of evening shuts the door and leaves the small interior to the mouseâ€ (199).â€

For example, unless a housewife had access to natural ice, she would have â€œno refrigeration after the mechanical icebox stops mnning. When the toaster goes dead, the electric orange squeezer gives up the ghost - breakfast will take that much longer to prepare. Have no hope it can be any differentâ€¦ unless we make the usefulness of our household goods outlast the length of the war.â€]â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œA pang of regret touched many hearts when the news of the death of Dr Thorndyke, the famous forensic medico, was published a few weeks ago.  (I mean of course the death of Austin Freeman; in first-rate detective fiction, the creator is annihilated by his creation.)  It was not easy to become intimate with Thorndyke.  He was a robot of inductionâ€“always strong against romantic investigation.  He distrusted intuition.  His technical knowledge was so wide and so minute that on occasion he became a bit of a bore with it.  Yet he never showed off about it.  He used to quietly say: â€˜We may as well.â€™  and then do things, incomprehensible to the layman, with dusting powders, refined chemicals and portable <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, which were carried by his assistant, Polton, in what must have been a compressible boxâ€“one of those cases you can squash when they begin to bulge.  Had Thorndyke no close friend?  He had one.  What was the friendâ€™s name?  I know, because I have just looked it up.  It was Jarvis.  I had forgotten it.  Jarvis was nobody.  Austin Freeman disdained character-creation.â€

Heâ€™s currently operating his <span class="red">gadget</span> stand on the Pacific Coast to reported big geedus counts.  â€¦  Following a stay of many months, Stanley Naldrett closed his <span class="red">gadget</span> bar in Silverâ€™s store, Birmingham, September 30, and headed for Chicago where he plans to visit briefly and cut up a few jackies.  He will reopen his <span class="red">gadget</span> layout in the Birmingham store January 3.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œPulling power of radio was dramatically demonstrated recently when a client, <span class="red">Gadget</span> of the Month Club, was all but snowed under by tremendous response to plugs bought thru the spot sales department of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC).  <span class="red">Gadget</span> of the Month, via blurbs on the webâ€™s managed, owned and represented stations, was getting around 15,000 responses daily on its offer of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> for a small sum of money.  Lacking a national distribution setup, the firm fell far behind on deliveriesâ€“which resulted in stations getting plenty of squawks from listeners.  For a time some stations were afraid theyâ€™d have to take a loss and refund moola to listeners, but itâ€™s claimed that the company is now caught up on deliveries.  According to Don Davis of the agency of Davis, Harrison, &amp; Simonds, <span class="red">Gadget</span>s of the Month has now bought time on 350 outlets.  For a time, however, stations were plenty jittery.  Tex McCrary, for instance, on WNBC, NBCâ€™s New York key, asked listeners to let him known if they had failed to receive their <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.â€

These folders, which aim to create a romantic atmosphere, are labeled Rocky Mountain View, American Venice, Marmaduke Manor, Phoenix Park, Pacific Shores, Aztec Village, Wampum City, Quahog Beach, Casabianca, or Capri. Their streets are named after fruits, Presidents, ballplayers, movie stars, Indians, Eskimos, departed local celebrities, Scotch clans, and Riviera resorts. There are usually guarded references to a magnificent community clubhouse where good old Crestfallen Manor still stands, and to murmuring hemlocks, vast expanses of sandy beach on salt or fresh water, and so forth.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œHow much more Know-How is needed to make human life obsolete?  Is there any known <span class="red">gadget</span> for controlling a rampant Know-How?  The lady in the ad has found a mechanic substitute for moral choice?â€  â€œAs the ad implies, know-how is at once a technical and a moral sphere.  It is a duty for a woman to love her husband and also to love that soap that will make her husband love her.  It is a duty to be glamorous, cheerful, efficient, and, so far as possible, to run the home like an automatic factory.  This ad also draws attention to the tendency of the modern housewife, after a premarital spell in the business world, to embrace marriage and children but not housework.  Emotionally, she repudiates physical tasks with the same confection that she pursues hygiene.  And so the ad promises her a means of doing physical work without hating the husband who has dragged her into household drudgery.  /  To purchase <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that relieve this drudgery and thus promote domestic affection is, therefore, a duty, too.  And so it is that not only labor-saving appliances but food and nylons (â€˜your legs owe it to their audienceâ€™) are consumed and promoted with moral fervor.  /  But <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and gimmicks did not begin as physical objects, nor are they only to be understood as such today.  Benjamin Franklin, protean prototype and professor of know-how, is equally celebrated for both his material and psychological technology.  In his Autobiography, still a central feature of Yankee moral structure, he tells, for example, how he hit upon a system of moral bookkeeping which would enable any man to achieve perfection in several months.  The trick is to select only one fault at a time for deletion and by concentration and persistence the moral slate will soon be clean.  Related to this system was his discovery of various techniques for winning friends and influencing people which are still as serviceable as ever.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œJust where the first use in libraries of mechanical trivia was made is no doubt, thoroughly documented in the literature.  Quite possibly, the first â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>â€™ to gain general acceptance was some device as simple but as effective as the rubber date stamp.  Clipped to the end of a pencil, this little gem has has saved thousands of man-hours, and assisted in relegating â€˜library scriptâ€™ to the category of interesting leftovers in the card catalogs of university libraries. [â€¦] the machines and devices which are to be discussed here are those which may be regarded as simple extensions of the hander mind and which are designed to speed some operation or to relieve muscular strain, but not those intended to alter substantially the methods commonly used in libraries.  /  The common aim in introducing tools or machines into almost any process is to reduce the time or energy required to perform some operation or to produce a more uniformly satisfactory result.  To stick to this rule in the application of what may be referred to as â€˜<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>â€™ is sometimes difficult; many of these devices have a kind of fascination for some librarians which occasionally obscures the true economics of their applicationâ€ (239).  â€œThe popularity of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is attested to by the space allotted to them in such professional journals as the A.L.A. Bulletin [the â€œ<span class="red">Gadget</span>s, Gismos, and Gimmicksâ€ column], the Library Journal and PNLA Quarterly in the form of regular columns or departments and of articles proclaiming the success of their various applications.  A few examples of the types of items escrowed briefly in the PNLA Quarterly for January 1956 are: visible files, copying machines, paper cutter, copy follower, and routing forms.  Often these are already in use in libraries, but the wide range of materials listed shows the extent to which librarians search for things which may speed up their work.â€  * * * See the â€œreview of the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> used in one libraryâ€ broken down by genre, as well as discussion of how they are arranged at work stations â€œso that the work in which they are used may be performed in a consistent and logical flow,â€ on p. 242.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe wonderfully imaginative and often fantastic world of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> was unfolded last week in the New York Trade Show Building, with more than 140 exhibitors taking part.  This was the second such effort promoted by a group of businessmen and managed by Hal Sommers, and the number of inventions aimed at simplifying everyday tasks came within a shade of doubling the total exhibited last year.  <span class="red">Gadget</span>s have always held a fascination for the man on the street and his better half.  Among the items which have been surefire crowd stoppers in the past are the little gimmicksâ€“the better mousetrap, so to speakâ€“which show at a glance how to do something quicker and cleaner.  Some of those shown in New York, however, are a bit obscure as far as practical purpose is concerned, but they still are interesting enough to win attention.  â€¦  The <span class="red">Gadget</span> Show was initiated last year as a showplace for thousands of unknown innovations that flow from the American inventive mind.  To facilitate the marketing of practical <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> the show management formed a <span class="red">Gadget</span> Manufacturersâ€™ Institute to counsel exhibitors in this yearâ€™s show.  It is staffed to conduct market research studies on bot consumer and trade levels, to define the potential markets for inventors and manufacturers.  The show was open to both consumers and trade.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œSince considerable heat (ill-wind) can be created thru poor presentations, sloppy work and phony items, it was editable that a <span class="red">gadget</span> workersâ€™ protective organization make an appearance.  The new non-profit Exhibitors Association of America, headquartered in California, has been incorporated with the avowed aim of stopping unfair practices bothy by and against demonstrators.  It would improve the level of the demonstration industry and protect it from space rent and percentage gouging.  /  The person working <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is all things to all viewers, wherever the public congregates.  If they want humor he has it; the same goes for the many other qualities necessary to successful entertainment on a personnel level.  It is so personal, in fact, that unlike high paid public performers, the <span class="red">gadget</span> workerâ€™s immediate audience rarely numbers more than three dozen people and is no more than 12 feet from him.  If he is a top-notcher, however, he could get 75 per cent of his tip (audience) to vote him into Congress as easily as spring (spend) for a sale.  /  Basically speaking, the new and novel item is a traffic-stopper, enabling the demonstrator to build his tip.  He presents it in a [sic] appealing way through humor, stories, etc., hooding his tipâ€™s attention while presenting the item.  Then comes his close (windup) and the request for sales.  Then comes a rehash of his spiel to convince additional viewers who have not sprung and also to hold the tip, which in itself is a good way to stop more traffic as passers-by gather to see whatâ€™s going on.  /  The business is a small one and far from the usual housewares salesmanship.  It has workers (commission agents) who act for the leaders, those pace-setters in the field.  There are independents, who do their own buying and renting of space, and who work alone except for an occasional partner or member of the family.  /  The fieldâ€™s code of ethics is not one that a banker would follow.  It is generally a cash-on-the-line business, but it is not improper to owe money for merchandise when one is tapped out (broke), but eventual payment is a must if a worker expects to last in the industry.  Demonstrators playing a red one (successful fair date or celebration) are prone to help out another clansman by lending money or merchandise.  Credit information is entirely word of mouth, however, and reputations are soon established for honesty and reliability.  /  Altho most demonstrators work on limited capital a great deal of money can be made quickly and lost just as fast, in the trade.  Experience brings with it the ability to judge the quality and potential earnings of a location, and the knack of securing an occasional ex for <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> at certain fairs, on traveling shows, and at stores.  Sometimes a respected worker can control all <span class="red">gadget</span> locations on a fairground by proving his competence to the fair secretary.  /  There is considerable disillusionment in the business,w which is constantly having its personnel weeded out as johnny-come-latelys fold up at the first sign of hardship.  Old-timers know, tho that rainy days soon pass, and when they do, the clan is busy at work building more tips and pocketing the profits.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œthe world of kitchen <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is never in finer fettle than during the fair season, when <span class="red">gadget</span> workers have already been pulling in cash at boardwalk stands, department stores and farmers markets.  This peculiar form of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> is aimed right at the women, and in the hands of capable workers, it hardly ever misses its mark.  /  During good times and bad there has always been a call for <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  They make their mark, last in popularity for a cycle of three years, more or less, then seemingly die as quickly as they were born.  But this is more a hibernation than death, since in kitchen <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> as in many other merchandising fields, old objects are frequently born over again and ride high on a new wave of popularity.  /  For example: 20 years ago a big item on boardwalks was the combination peeler-slicer, which both peeled and cored fruit such as apples, as well as scoring corn and being useful as a slicer.  That was 20 years ago, and itâ€™s on the scene again.  /  For example:  Three years ago, choppers became a hot item, starting with a Swiss import retailing at $1.98.  American versions, like Rotomatic and Chopomatic, competed with the Swiss Blitzhacker.  Price was $2.98.  Mass production overtook the price and stamped it down to $1.98 and even lower in some cases, causing some perplexity by price-conscious demonstrators.  Rotomatic was replaced by the Imperial Food Chopper during this period.  But this price confusion was followed by a waning popularity and it was decided to produce a super model with a bigger bowl, capable of holding more and bigger vegetables and eliminating the need to slice some of them down to chopper size.  Now we have the Grown Imperial.  /  From 1952-â€˜54 the handy little Mouli Grater ($1 retail) nurtured a company which has taken on a wider line of kitchen <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  There is a $2.98 Julienne and $4.98 Salad-Maker (retail).  /  Others among the wide assortment of plastic and metal gizmos directed at the American housewifeâ€“and so artfully demonstrated thruout the landâ€“include a handy radish cutter which creates a radish floweredâ€¦â€  /  * * * â€œ<span class="red">Gadget</span>s used to be set out on counters in cartons, but lately the poly bag has become a common display method.  One philosophy for this is that the American housewife wants to see what sheâ€™s buying.  Some French basket suppliers provide baskets in bulk, without any covering whatever.  The basket has come up so strongly that one manufacturer, fearful of rapid over-saturation, is offering a combination package.  This contains the French basket, a pastry maker, and pastrymanâ€™s cloth.  /  But there is virtually no end to the number of handy little <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> offered as time-savers for the American kitchen.  The target is the womenfolk and, praise be, they have responded in admirable fashion for generations, always pushovers for kitchen aids.â€  Later, kinds of objects:  â€œinexpensive tools, â€˜unbreakable combs,â€™ radio station clearing coils, and other inexpensive pieces of merchandise.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>â€™, which is defined by Webster as slang meaning a â€˜mechanical contrivance, a device, or any ingenious articleâ€™ has become a fundamental part of the American scene.â€  â€œOne cannot generalize from the study of these two cases. The psychological mechanisms described need not be characteristic of typical cultural attitudes, although there seems generally to be something derogatory in the use of the term, <span class="red">gadget</span>â€ (339).  â€œThe machine deals with the external world directly and, although there are many exceptions, strives to create order from disorder. One can say that it is similar to a secondary process operation which takes the unorganized and gives it organization. In most cases a human being is required to operate machines. The <span class="red">gadget</span> differs from the complex machine in that it minimizes the importance of the human being whereas the ordinary machine augments a personâ€™s capacity to do work which requires secondary process operations. For example, typewriting is the use of a machine to record ideas which are refined and organized in the process of transmitting them to the machine. The typewriter is thus a mechanical aid to the secondary process operation. The <span class="red">gadget</span>, on the other hand, requires a minimum of human intervention and gives the illusion of operating independently.  /  One cannot conceive of a machine performing secondary process operations independently, because in order to accomplish such a function there must also be a primary process. There are, however, a variety of electronic computers that seem almost to be able to think. Cybernetics, as we all know, has viewed the psychic apparatus in terms analogous to those of an electronic circuit and has caused machines to be built that function in a manner that is analogous to human logic.  /  Both patients stressed that the function of a <span class="red">gadget</span> is secondary in importance to its operation, which obscured its purpose to them. Whether it worked or not, in terms of accomplishing what it is supposed to do, was a minor consideration. This does not mean that the <span class="red">gadget</span> did not have to work perfectly in a mechanical sense, because if it did not the <span class="red">gadget</span>eer would be frustrated. What it did mean, to both the patients, was that the human appreciation of what the <span class="red">gadget</span> accomplishes, for example, reproduction of music in such a way as to provide a gratifying and moving experience, tended to take second place in their minds to a pleasure in the operation of the <span class="red">gadget</span> itself.â€ (336).  â€œCommon among all the patients in this group was anger toward the <span class="red">gadget</span> and the â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>eerâ€™. To define these terms for the purpose of this paper is not easy. Any technological device, especially when first introduced, can be considered a <span class="red">gadget</span>. These patients for the most part objected to two aspects of these devices which may be classified as follows. First, the regulation of time as in switches with either an automatic control or a feed-back mechanism to interrupt a circuit and turn something off or on. Included were such items as furnace controls, coffee makers, and radio switches that turn other mechanisms on and off. Second, enhancement of passivity. In this class can be included practically all objects that do work, and consequently permit more leisure. Automatic dishwashers, automatic transmissions in automobiles, and, especially, remote control of television without getting up from oneâ€™s armchair are a threat because of the enhancement of passivity.  Television itself was scorned by one patient who nevertheless succumbed to its lure and then watched it for hours every night. One patient was particularly chagrined to learn there was a switch that automatically controls a fan for ventilating a house, depending on the amount of heat in the attic. That it required a minimum of human intervention for its operation was what this patient found most disturbing.  /  This classification is sketchy and not technologically precise. As it is manifestly impossible to state definitely where invention ends and <span class="red">gadget</span>eering begins, it is striking that these patients frequently made such arbitrary distinctions. Patients pointed out that function was of little importance; the operation of the <span class="red">gadget</span> was the primary feature. One patient spoke with anger of persons who were more interested in the tonal qualities of complex high fidelity sets than in the music. He referred to a recent joke of a person who contented himself with studying the wave patterns produced by an oscillograph hooked into the system.â€  (330)  Catalogues patients who can only appreciate photographs and not painting for instance, appreciating technical perfection over beauty.  â€œIn these instances, it is the person who is ingenious, not the machine; and such a person strives to be capable of accomplishing almost anything. The omnipotent qualities of such fantasies are extremely valuable in enhancing narcissism. Such a fantasy, especially when it is as compulsive as it was in both these patients, serves as a narcissistic, omnipotent, magical defense against the inner awareness of a weak and constricted egoâ€ (339).  â€œTo this artist, as it was to the scientist, the <span class="red">gadget</span> served as an intensive means of communicating with reality.â€  â€œIn both these patients, the <span class="red">gadget</span> was not only a factor that represented the operation of the secondary process, which is in opposition to instinctual forces, but, more specifically, it was a factor in preserving identity. In the first case, there was a direct correlation between the patientâ€™s interest in <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and security in his identity. In the second case, there seemed to be an inverse correlation; greater preoccupation with the <span class="red">gadget</span> threatened the patientâ€™s ego ideal, and made him feel less secure of his identity.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œMake up a package of all the things a new home canâ€™t do without. What? A ball of twine, Scotch tape, a pair of kitchen shears, a box of elastic bands, a package of small pads for marketing lists, a box of sharpened pencils, a tiny tool kit, some pushpins, a new telephone-address book for both husband and wife, a box of kitchen matches, an extension cord, a <span class="red">gadget</span> to unscrew jar lids, and anything else youâ€™ve found you canâ€™t get along without.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe average modern man uses his muscles as little as possible, and todayâ€™s labor-saving <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> really pamper him. The resulting muscle weakness shows in three places. First, many men and most women are weak in hands, arms, shoulders, and upper trunk muscles.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe pages present succinct descriptions, drawings and photographs of about three dozen marvelous <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> from the heroic history of technology, all realized as working models.  There is no attempt to follow scale, materials or finish in authentic detail; the aim is to abstract and exhibit the â€˜particular goâ€™ of each machine.  Most of the devices are to be made at the woodworkerâ€™s bench, with some sheet-metal, plastic, rope or hardboard parts.  A number call for machined metal gearing that is beyond amateur skills; one can criticize the absence of much effort here to help young people take advantage of the rich marketplace of manufactured parts in our technological era.  The book is nonetheless a pleasure and a challenge.  Who would not like to see working models of the device used to generate screw threads without copying any existing thread; of the chinese spoon-tilt hammer, an automatic water-power scheme still familiar in Japanese gardens, or of the cornish man-engine, a vertical moving belt of miners, forerunner of the mine hoist?â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œIs there a fuse blown and you havenâ€™t noticed because you havenâ€™t been anywhere else in the house? Are the control buttons correctly set and pushed in or turned all the way? Is the door or lid closed securely? A careful check first can save you time, money and a good deal of chagrin when a hastily summoned repairman does nothing more than reach down and nonchalantly push the electric plug back into the socket. A word about some of the lesser labor-savers, the kitchen <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, in particular. Think about them before you buy them. If they will not represent a real convenience, or you would not use them regularly, forget them. They take up valuable space, add to clutter, and do not pay their way in saving time. Sometimes they waste time. The mechanical hand chopper has not yet been invented that will do a more efficient job than a good sharp knife and a supple wrist attached to the arm of an accomplished cook.â€

I expected her to look disappointed. but somewhere she had learned to keep her expectations at a minimum, and, without fuss, she snapped the money into her purse, sent me a naughty reproach with her eyes when I groped for her, and went off: to the bathroom to prepare her pre-coital toilet. I stretched out on the bed and waited. This was an interim which I had grown used to since the advent of intimate hygiene and devilish <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> to yard off conception. One no longer coaxed and vheedled a woman into bed, there to have her in a twirl of unconsidered passion. No, now, at the nace nent when Molly Bloom said â€œ yes, â€œ at the instant shell the dark declivities are moist and ready, there: comes a whispered entreaty for patience and the wavy clump of footsteps in the darkness as the lady slips away to her vaginal laboratory.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œNew York Cityâ€™s Parks Department had a problem: tree thieves. One night somebody pinched 80 rhododendrons along upper Fifth Avenue; last year thieves dug up and hauled away more than $55,000 worth of newly planted shrubs and trees. Now the Parks people rig each new planting with a chain shackled to a stake. The stake is dropped into the hole and turned horizontally. Then the plant roots are arranged around the stake, the hole is filled and the entire <span class="red">gadget</span> concealed with earth. The Parks Department claims it has foiled at least one would-be thief. Workmen in Central Park recently found a plant with all the dirt dug out around its roots, but still firmly anchored to its stake.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe striking thing about the stories, when I listen to the tape now, is that they are both laughing over and over about the absurdity of the situation that our brother journalists were (are) attempting to record as another solemn chapter in the continuing history of warfare, meanwhile celebrating the old macho exhilaration of being shot at and missed. Flynn and Stone enjoyed the war. So did every other correspondent in Vietnam. We enjoyed the bitter humor and the proximity to all the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> of war; even those of us who never shared the all-American fascination with weapons of death got a certain charge from being with those who did. We were heirs to the tradition of war, and war still meant finding the personal courage to edge right up to death while staying calm. It was no more or less complicated than a response to the ultimate challenge as outdated and senseless as a barroom showdown. And so we had this war, and my friends and I had to be there.â€

Our neighbor John Burtz was found swinging from the ceiling of his farm shed last week by one of his seven children. He had wound a noose around his throat, then pulled the hydraulic lift of his bulldozer. He was a laughing, brawny man with meat on his breath, it was said that he loved machines excessively, that he was <span class="red">gadget</span> crazy, deeply in debt. At the funeral, his two brothers come into the church trying to support his widow by each arm. A useless gesture, since she walks steadfast and crisply, supporting them if anything, with no outward show of grief. At the cemetery they stand very close together in front of the grave, huddled together like cattle seeking warmth, the raw November air pierces like needles, the sky is of the low, unvariegated gray that precurses snow.â€
