  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œA discussion arose at the Plymouth meeting of the Devonshire Association in 1916 when it was suggested that this word should be recorded in the list of local verbal provincialisms.  Several members dissented from its inclusion on the ground that it is in common use throughout the country and a naval officer who was present said that it has for years been a popular expression in the service for a tool or implement, the exact name of which is unknown or has for the moment been forgotten.  I have also frequently heard it applied by motor-cycle friends to the collection of fitments to be seen on motor cycles. â€˜His handle-bars are smothered in <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>â€™ refers to such things as speedometers, mirrors, levers, badges, mascots, &amp;c., attached to the steering handlesâ€.  /  â€˜<span class="red">Gadget</span>â€™ is a colloquialism in the Navy for any small fitment or uncommon articleâ€“for example, â€˜a curious <span class="red">gadget</span>.â€™  I never came across anybody who could give a derivation.â€ -A.G. Kealy  /  â€œIn a list of words and phrases used by our soldiers at the Front, sent to me recently from Flanders, there is the word â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>,â€™ and its meaning is given as billets or quarters of any description, â€˜and sometimes it is used to denote a thing of which the name is not known.â€™â€ â€“Archibald Sparke.  /  â€˜Websterâ€™s New International Dictionaryâ€™ says that â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>â€™ is often used of something novel, or not known by its proper name (slang).â€™  It is a word in frequent use in this sense by seamen and other workers.â€ â€“F.A.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œA College Professor Solves a Mathematical Problem and Becomes a Wealthy Inventor.  Most of us are likely to think of an inventor as eagerly seeking some idea upon which to exercise his genius, and then bending over a work bench surrounded with wheels, wires and miscellaneous <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> trying first this combination and then that until he works out his invention.  /  He gets his patent and makes the rounds of manuÂ­facturers, all save one of whom laugh at his radical ideas, but that one sees something in it and makes a fortune.  /  The other day we were talking with an inventor who is not like that at all. He never thought of himself as an inventor, never looked for anything to invent, never had any intention of making a lot of money, believes he is weak in imagination-that quality so often considered necessary to successÂ­ful invention-has put in far more time writing a book than he has done in inventing, has done his inÂ­ venting only as a sort of side line and never bothered pedÂ­dling an invention around among manufacturers. All the inventing he does is with a pen and a note book. And yet Louis Alan Hazeltine has made a fortune out of his inventions. The best known of them, of course, is the NeuÂ­trodyne radio receiver.â€

Articles for comfort and convenience, devices for diversion and amusement were multiplying with sensational rapidity, giving promise of a satisfaction even more gratifying.  Corporations were swelling in size, holding companies were rising to dizzy heights, the tide of liquid claims to wealth were flooding in.â€

The so-called bottlenecks of industrial production are looming large in Germany, England, even the United States, and professional economists everywhere are coming to insist that you may have large unemployment along with a serious shortage of skilled labor? indeed, paradoxically enough, the labor shortage may to a considerable extent be responsible for unemployment. The failure of one highly specialized factory manufacturing a particular <span class="red">gadget</span> may hold up a great deal of industrial production which depends directly or indirectly upon that particular <span class="red">gadget</span>.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe <span class="red">Gadget</span> Maker is a 1955 novel by Maxwell Griffith. It is notable for its vivid depiction of an otherwise-rarely-described milieu: campus life at MIT in the 1940s. It also presents a striking engineers-eye-view of guided missile development at a West Coast aerospace firm during the early days of the cold war.  On its appearance, the New York Times described The <span class="red">Gadget</span> Maker as â€œthe story of a misguided zealot devoted body and soul to the advancement of knowledgeâ€ and called it â€œan absorbing narrative [and] a clear presentation of technological subject-matter, written with stylistic ease and fluidity by an author who is himself a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.â€  Just a few phrases in the novel, such as â€œEssentially, engineering was the skilled bending and shaping of metals into airplanes, bridges, cars, <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> galore.  Still, it required more than a skill at fabricationâ€“an understanding, some vital spark of creativeness.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œLike the theory of games, it is a method of pure mathematics that can be applied to human affairs.  It is used to calculate the best possible solution to a problem that involves a number of variables.  [â€¦]  To illustrate the method let us take a highly simplified hypothetical case.  We have a factory that can make two products, which for simplicityâ€™s sake we shall name â€˜widgetsâ€™ and â€˜<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.â€™â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe Khazars bust out in the east and knockthe Lombards into Italy. The Franks move into Frankland. f Martel needs money, confiscates church lands to maintain a cavalry, and so his grandson drives in and knocks the Lombards for a loop in Italy and gets crowned by the Pope right over there, â€œ thumb back at St. Peterâ€™s. â€œ The big sweep. Hundreds of years. Where does that leave one man or ten? And itâ€™s only a paragraph. A tribe agitated by bad crops here, a <span class="red">gadget</span> there. Who can tell whatâ€™ll count? Louis the Fourteenth wins an argument about the windows at Versailles, so the builder loses his generalâ€™s job, and the French lose in Holland so you get a Dutch king of England.â€
