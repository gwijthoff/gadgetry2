  â€œAs a musician and a music critic, I have learned that listening is an active pursuit, a discipline. It involves putting the mindset of <span class="red">gadget</span>land on hold - you know, â€œitâ€™s all about me, my playlist!â€ -, and being willing to receive input from the outside worldâ€

  â€œIt seems like ages since Amazon introduced us to the $199 Fire at a hectic New York City event, but in truth that was only about six weeks ago. Maybe our perception of time is warped because weâ€™ve been hearing talk about this 7-inch Android tablet for months now. Maybe itâ€™s because Amazon launching a tablet seemed like such a natural thing to do after Barnes &amp; Noble paved the way with its Nook Color. Or, maybe itâ€™s just because the <span class="red">gadget</span> Amazon shipped looks nigh-identical to the 7-inch BlackBerry PlayBook that weâ€™ve had for, well, ages.â€

  â€œWeâ€™ve more or less accepted e-readers as the best way to read a book digitally, but thereâ€™s still a whole lot that <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> can do that e-readers suck atâ€”literally anything you own with a screen is better at this stuff than an e-reader. The Kindle Touch is the first to really bridge that gap in a way that makes sense.â€ A particular kind of electronic device â€“ cellphone or tablet, as opposed to e-reader.â€

  â€œThe idea that Tebow would solve the Jetsâ€™ locker room issues is ridiculous. As a <span class="red">gadget</span> player? Or third string QB? Come on. Can not see how this doesnâ€™t turn into a mess. Few bad games by Sanchez and wonâ€™t people be calling for Tebow?â€  <span class="red">Gadget</span> play or <span class="red">gadget</span> player as something quirky, unusual, probably can only be used a small number of times to throw off a defense before they adapt.â€
