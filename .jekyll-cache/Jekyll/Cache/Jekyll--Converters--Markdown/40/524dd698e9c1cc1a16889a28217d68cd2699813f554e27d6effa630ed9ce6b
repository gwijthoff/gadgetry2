  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThis is a political tract, set in a boiler-room (similar to those in coal-burning vessels of the time) in Hell where various souls are being punished for their sins.  â€œâ€˜Harnessed up the tideâ€“the cool, big, wet, deep, blue, sparkling sea.  I believe they did it on the pneumatic principle, not on the hydraulic, if youâ€™re interested in those things.â€™  â€˜I ainâ€™t,â€™ Mr. Sugden retorted.  â€˜Iâ€™m only concerned with outstanding social facts.  We leave machinery to the intellectuals.â€™  â€˜Thatâ€™s very kind of you.

One little <span class="red">gadget</span> is added to meet one objection and another little <span class="red">gadget</span> to overcome the disadvantages of the first, until the sum of a lot of little attempts to do the right is the great wrong of tying government and taxpayers in a mass of red tapeâ€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œWhen the President pushes an ivory button on his desk to open the sluices of Hoover Dam or light up the symbolic Tower of Something or Other at a worldâ€™s fair, reporters, newsreel cameras and microphones are always there to trumpet abroad the drama of the occasion. When John Smith registers at a metropolitan hotel in the modern tradition, that is another simple act which sets in motion a machine as impressive as any 10,000-ton <span class="red">gadget</span> in a powerhouse. But this huge, part-human, part-mechanical organization is out of sight and silent, all the more so the better it works. If he realized the amount of smoothly oiled routine called for by the mere fact of his arrival, John Smith might get a swelled head. Which would be unfortunate, because, as the above parable indicates, this machine has a double function: It is tooled and synchronized to supply the guest whatever he wants with so much speed and so little inconvenienceâ€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œIn other words, I should not be surprised if the youngest generation were taking a realistic view of politics.

The scoutâ€™s young men may be taking the practical, hard-boiled view that government is a <span class="red">gadget</span> which is meant to work for the good of society while you sleep, and is not doing it.  This is a good sound view.  Looking at government as a <span class="red">gadget</span>, here are a few questions which come up.  â€¦  First, then, since the governmental <span class="red">gadget</span> is supposed to work for the rest of society, how can it best do that?â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThis strange way of speaking can best be explained if we know what was going on in their minds during that time. Suppose, they said, that one could bombard the nuclei of atoms with charged particles. To obtain these, the experimenter would take simple atoms such as hydrogen, or helium, and knock off the outer electrons by throwing them violently around in an electrical discharge or in some other way. The <span class="red">gadget</span> in which this â€œknocking offâ€ process occurred would be connected to a large, highly evacuated glass or porcelain â€œaccelerating tube.â€ The particles could be led into this tube and, by the application of high voltage, could be accelerated or shot against a target covered with the atoms of the element to be investigated.â€

The Pulse of Democracy was the title of Gallupâ€™s book in 1940.  â€˜The saviors of democracyâ€™ was the appraisal of one University of Chicago professor; â€˜a social <span class="red">gadget</span>â€™ was the epithet of another professor of the same university.  â€˜A measure of our social illiteracy is the appropriate phrase, according to a leader in adult education.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œIn his laboratory rink Rawson demonstrated the proper functioning of the roller skate.  The sake is attached to one of his <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> which shows the flexible action of the skate when the weight of the body is shifted to the outside and then to the inside.  You are then taken to another <span class="red">gadget</span> with a platform just big enough to accommodate one person.  Once on this <span class="red">gadget</span> there are two arms that clamp firmly about your hips so that they are held firm.  However, your limbs from the hips down are free, as is the upper part of your body.  Your hands then grasp the handles about waist high.  You are instructed to stand straight and close to the upright part of the <span class="red">gadget</span> but to avoid stiffness.  Once these instructions are carried out Rawson snaps an electric switch and you swing like the pendulum of a clock.  This <span class="red">gadget</span> conveys the action of the lean, and the beginner readily learns the feel and the meaning of the lean which he will apply later when the skates have been attached to his feet.â€

How much is God? How much is community? The ladâ€™s question was direct and simple; but as deep as depth; as long as forever; as high as the farthest unimagined star. What he means of course was how many dollars would it cost him to get one of those mysterious <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that catch pictures from the air. But television, community, lifeâ€™s ultimate reallties are never purchasable in dollars and cents; yet there is real meaning in asking how much they cost.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œBut it may also be due to the style of the book. This  is  more  journalistic  than  literary, and sometimes the choice of words is not too  particular.  For  example,  it  quotes Samuel Butler to the effect that the â€œhen is  the  eggâ€™s  device  for  laying  another egg.â€ Now what  Samuel  Butler  actually said,  at least in his  Life and Habit,  was something different,  namely,  that â€œa hen is  only  an  eggâ€™s  way  of making  another egg.â€  He  was  worrying  about  hens  not as <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, but as individuals. The lapse is  an interesting  one,  an intimation that in  the  authorsâ€™  minds  problems  of  inÂ­dividuality belong to the  19th century of the  old-fashioned  nature  rather  than  to the 20th century of population  genetics. Yet the paradox remains that the fascinaÂ­tion of biology to the novice as well as to the  specialist depends even  now  on  the relationship  of  the  individual  to  his group,  and  not  on  considerations  of  the group alone.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œWidgets and <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> (the terms are basically interchangeable) are small programs that you can add to your computer desktop, if you are running a newer version of Windows or Mac OS, or to a personalized Web portal such as iGoogle or Netvibes. These handy little applications can remind you about appointments, tell you the time or let you check your e-mail. They can also feed you the latest news headlines â€“ the perfect way for you to stay in the loop.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe idea that Tebow would solve the Jetsâ€™ locker room issues is ridiculous. As a <span class="red">gadget</span> player? Or third string QB? Come on. Can not see how this doesnâ€™t turn into a mess. Few bad games by Sanchez and wonâ€™t people be calling for Tebow?â€  <span class="red">Gadget</span> play or <span class="red">gadget</span> player as something quirky, unusual, probably can only be used a small number of times to throw off a defense before they adapt.â€
