  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œBefore I had time to question him as to his meaning, the old man emerged from the cabin loaded with sundry strange-looking machines, and followed by the steward bearing more.  For a few minutes he was mighty busy placing his menagerie in order, and then he turned to me and said briskly, â€˜Now, Mr. Roper, Iâ€™m all ready, go forrard and invite the hands aft to the lecture.â€™  [â€¦]  The skipper was as busy as two people about his wheels and things, and the unhappy steward like an image of fear obeyed mechanically the various commands of his dread master.  At last a whirring sound was heard like the humming of some huge imprisoned bee, and to this accompaniment the skipper took up his parable and preceded to talk.  [â€¦]  Indeed, from what I could see of their faces, I believe every other sense was merged in the full expectation of an explosion, and they couldnâ€™t have taken their strained eyes off the buzzing <span class="red">gadget</span> in their midst for any consideration whatever.â€  a monkey rushes the apparatus, something explodes, then:  â€œâ€˜Mr. Roper, I shanâ€™t give any more scientific exhibitions this trip; I think theyâ€™re immoral.â€™  With that he hobbled into his cabin, and we saw no more of him for a week.  When we did, you couldnâ€™t have got a grain of science out of him with a small-tooth combâ€¦â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œA man once went into an ironmongerâ€™s shop and said hesitantly: â€˜Do you sell those <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> for fixing on doors?â€™  /  â€˜Well, sir,â€™ replied the assistant, â€˜I am not quite sure if I understand your requirements, but I take it you are needing a patent automatic door-closer?â€™  /  â€˜Exactly,â€™ said the customer.  â€˜One to fix on my pantry door which, by the way, contains a glass window.â€™  /  â€˜You will want a cheap one, sir?â€™  /  â€˜Cheap but serviceable.â€™  /  â€˜You will prefer an English make, sir?â€™  /  â€˜Indeed, thatâ€™s a most important consideration.â€™  /  /You will perhaps want one with ornamentation, scroll work and roses, for instance?â€™  /  â€˜Oh, no, nothing of the sort, thank you.  What I want is as plain and unobtrusive as possible.â€™  /  â€˜You would like it made of some rustless metal, sir?â€™  /  â€˜That would be very convenient.â€™  /  â€˜And with a strong spring?â€™  /  â€˜Well, moderately strong.â€™  /  â€˜To be fixed on which side, sir?â€™  /  /Let me see; the right-hand side.â€™  /  â€˜Now, sir,â€™ said the assistant, â€˜I will go through each point, one by one.  You want an efficient (but not too costly) English made, unobtrusive, rustless, unornamented, patent automatic door closer, to be fixed right-handed with a moderately strong spring to a pantry door with a gas window.  Is there anything further, sir?â€™  /  â€˜Well, itâ€™s very good of you to help me like this,â€™ said the customer.  â€˜I should also like it easily adjusted and easily removable, and above all it must not squeak or need constant oiling.â€™  /  â€˜In fact,â€™ said the clerk, â€˜you want an apparatus combining a variety of qualities, in a word, an absolutely silent, efficient, economical, invisible, corrosive-proof, unonramented, not-too-heavily-springed, easily adjustable, readily removable, British-made, right-handed, patent automatic door closer, ideally fitted in every possible respect for attaching your pantry door which (I understand you to say) contains a glass window.

Good day, sir.â€™â€  (61-62)  â€œWell, thatâ€™s the story of the ideal <span class="red">gadget</span>.  People like Mr. Brickell, Mr. Krutch and Mr. Villard are saddened by the fact that there are no ideally perfect, readily noble, spiritually supreme workers on the market upon whom they could put their faith to carry through a revolution which shall be quite as noble and as perfect as they themselves are.  It is regrettable, but unavoidable, that the Communists must be compelled to carry through a revolution with the present assortment of workers who od not possess all those noble, idea qualities without which Mr. Brickell and Mr. Krutch do not see the possibilities of establishing a world which shall release men from the miseries and the exploitations which they now suffer.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œWhen the impulses are few and the cortex is comparatively inactive, the brain wave slow down and normal sleep results.  One is tempted by the picture of an electron beam scanning the tube face of a television camera, picking up impressions left by the outside world from one tiny region after another.  But whether such beams of nerve impulses, playing upon the cortex, do actually control attention, whether they are responsible for the evocation of specific memory traces, only the future can decide.  /  We are beginning to have some reasonable guesses as to the â€˜<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>â€™ that would serve as a memory mechanismâ€“guesses sufficiently concrete to permit testing by rigorous experimentation.  I think it is realistic to hope for an understanding of memory precise enough to permit experimental modification of it in men.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe holdup killers, shooting up the town and spreading tackâ€™s on the road behind them to hinder pursuit, made, good their escape. As chance would have it, the South Braintree crime occurred at the precise moment when Chief Stewart, Pinkerton? agents and immigrationâ€™ inspectors were turning up some curious angles that, Chief Stewart felt, might be related to the Bridgewater holdup - attempt. The Pinkertons had located an improbable witness who claimed to have invented a crime machine. One look into this unlikely <span class="red">gadget</span>, according to, the inventor, would tell you just who committed any given crime. The Pinkertons, skeptical people, werenâ€™t very interested, in the crime machine, but they were decidedly interested in the gossip itsâ€™ creator hadâ€™ picked Up in the Italian, community. AcCOrding to this, the men involved in the Bridgewater holdup attempt had been Italian anarchists who had been living in a shack near, the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy.)â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œSmoluchowskiâ€™s  point  can  be  better appreciated by translating it into modern terms. Although he refers to recent progress  in  electronics,  ideas  such  as  the  rectification  of  an  alternating  voltage  had barely arisen in his time. Today the principle of rectification plays a major role in such  solid-state  electronic  devices  as  diodes  and  transistors.  These  devices  are analogous  to  the  hypothetical  <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that  translate  the  up-and-down  movement of a Brownian particle into a purely upward  motion,  or  that  perform  the  old demonâ€™s trick of permitting only fast molecules to go from left to right.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œTo understand it we must first realize that we are going to make very little real progress in solving the problem of pollution until we recognize it for what, primarily, it is: an economic problem which must he understood in economic terms. Of course, there are noneconomic aspects of pollution, as there are with all economic problems, but all too often, such secondary matters dominate discussion. Engineers, for example, are certain that pollution will vanish once they find the magic <span class="red">gadget</span> or power source. Politicians keep trying to find the right kind of bureaucracy: and bureaucrats maintain an unending search for the correct set of rules and regulations. Those who are above such vulgar pursuits pin their hopes on a moral regeneration or social revolution, apparently in the belief that saints and socialists have no garbage to dispose of.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œM-m-m, well, it varies. With thousands of shipping outfits plying these lanes, we can expect several craft per year to stop by, though we never know in advance. However, what we do know is if anybodyâ€™s within thirty â€“ forty kilometers. A little <span class="red">gadget</span> that detects thoughts. So you canâ€™t monitor us unbeknownst. We can warn off ships; they do radio us from orbit before landing. Chances are theyâ€™d come down anyway, but maintain camouflage. All youâ€™d observe or photograph would be a colored blur like ordinary ball lightning.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œHe laid a few more of his ideas on us, and weâ€™ll settle for one dazzler. THIS IDEA depends on electronic miniaturization. He wants to marry radio and computer technology into a tiny device you wear on your wrist or carry in your pocket The device is prograthmed to broadeast (like aâ€™garage door opener) pertinentâ€™ information such as your age, astrological sign, tastes, and availability for friendship or romance. This <span class="red">gadget</span> sends out messages every 20 seconds, and also receives kindred messageC So youâ€™re out walking in Lincoln Park some day and suddenly your <span class="red">gadget</span>1tarts buzzing, and you look around and see a stranger who also has a buzzing <span class="red">gadget</span>. Instant friendship. He hasnâ€™t named it yet. How about Mt. St. Helenâ€™s Romance Router? Incidentally, we checked with the St Louis Better Business BUreau and the Missouri attorney generes, office, and they, have no beefs against Busch or his company.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œIf I were to elaborate, you would see that each step was perfectly logical and that these gentle sybarites did nothing to rush me. Nor was there even the mildest attempt to seduce me, not even a hint that I had already raped (symbolic rape, at least) my host the night before. Then I shared with them a sybaritic feast in their living room (drawing room, great hall, whatever) in front of a fire that was actually one of Ianâ€™s <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>. I was dressed in one of Janetâ€™s negligees â€“ Janetâ€™s notion of a dinner-gown negligee would have got her arrested in Christchurch. But it did not cause a pass from either man.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe ache of waking was still too sharp for him to bear. In the dream, he had forgotten what he was. Nothing human, but only a <span class="red">gadget</span>. Half machine and half alive, a creation of computer science and genetic engineering, his mind â€“ rather, his own controlling program? patched from bits of skill and know-how the Defender had been expected to require, his human recollections a haphazard mix picked up by lab accident. Floating weightless in the dark birthcell, he explored himself again. The cold and hairless flesh, pliantly metallic. The throbbing umbilical, only slightly warmer, coiling out of darkness to his belly.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThis little <span class="red">gadget</span> of mine can send out eight different beams with a total horsepower output of around eight thousand per minute per beam. From each beam you can draw enough power to turn the page of a book or fly a superstratosphere plane. Hold on â€“ I havenâ€™t finished yet. Each beam, as I told you before, returns a signal from receiver to transmitter. This not only controls the power output of the beam, but directs it. Once contact is made, the beam will never let goâ€
