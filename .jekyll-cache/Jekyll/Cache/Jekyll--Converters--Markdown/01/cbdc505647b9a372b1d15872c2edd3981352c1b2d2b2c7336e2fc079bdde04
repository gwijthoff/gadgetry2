  â€œBesides its many handsome diagrams and striking photographs, it possessed a side pocket containing a collapsible, multicolored dodecahedron (held toÂ­gether by rubber bands which made it self-erecting when removed from its hidÂ­ ing place), a set of motion-picture â€˜cards which when rapidly riffled displayed cerÂ­tain geometrical laws, a pair of red and green Cagliostro spectacles which conÂ­ferred three dimensions on the bookâ€™s several anaglyphs, and a few other equally ingenious <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>. Dr. Steinhausâ€™ introduction was so modest and amiable as to disarm all criticism. â€œYou are right,â€ he said, â€œthere is no system in this book; important things are omitted and trifles are emphasized. Many things do not deserve the name of mathematics, and the author himself does not seem to know what his aim really was in publishÂ­ ing his â€˜mathematical snapshots.â€™ They are too scientific for a child and too childish for a mathematician.â€ Still, this was excessively modest. For Steinhaus succeeded not only in serving up a reÂ­ past of mathematical objects â€œas pecuÂ­liar as the most exotic beast or bird,â€ but his book, for all its grab-bag disorder and despite the fact that his morsels rarely more than tickled the appetite for the strange and wonderful, afforded an amazing display of the richness, the vaÂ­riety and especially the interrelatedness of mathematical thought. His snapshots had a dual role. They were often beauÂ­tiful and fascinating in themselves and from that standpoint it was unnecessary to ask what they meant. Yet they were also pictorial representations of purely abstract relations possessing universal validity. Thus they could illumine for the thoughtful reader something of the nature of intellectual process-how we are able to interpret the physical world and make coherent and useful systems describing its behavior. The very mishÂ­ mash quality of the book serves to carry out this purpose.â€

  â€œThe attempts through the years to get a broader, looser conception of patents than the Constitution contemplates have been persistent.  The Patent Office, like most administrative agencies, has looked with favor on the opportunity which the exercise of discretion affords to expand its own jurisdiction.  And so it has placed a host of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> under the armor of patents â€“ <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that obviously have had no place in the constitutional scheme of advancing scientific knowledge. A few that have reached this Court show the pressure to extend monopoly to the simplest of devices:  Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 248: doorknob made of clay, rather than metal or wood, where different shaped door knobs had previously been made of clay.  Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v. Howard, 20 Wall. 498: rubber caps put on wood pencils to serve as erasers.  Union Paper Collar Co. v. Van Dusen, 23 Wall. 530: making collars of parchment paper where linen paper and linen had previously been used.  Page 340 U. S. 157  Brown v. Piper, 91 U. S. 37: a method for preserving fish by freezing them in a container operating in the same manner as an ice cream freezer.  Reckendorfer v. Faber, 92 U. S. 347: inserting a piece of rubber in a slot in the end of a wood pencil to serve as an eraser.  Dalton v. Jennings, 93 U. S. 271: fine thread placed across open squares in a regular hairnet to keep hair in place more effectively.  Double-Pointed Tack Co. v. Two Rivers Mfg. Co., 109 U. S. 117: putting a metal washer on a wire staple.â€  etc. etc.  â€œThe patent involved in the present case belongs to this list of incredible patents which the Patent Office has spawned. The fact that a patent as flimsy and as spurious as this one has to be brought all the way to this Court to be declared invalid dramatically illustrates how far our patent system frequently departs from the constitutional standards which are supposed to govern.â€

  â€œWell, I do it thisaway. The glass rotates while the template slides over it, back and forth. The linkage keeps the template always vertical. Throw on the abrasive and both glass and template automatically go paraboloid, the only curve we know of that can be made that way. Starting, say, with a hemisphere, or any segment of a sphere, and a thin, circular template, you can keep going and get any focal length you want. Of course, the above is a convex paraboloid but it works equally well on a concave one.  /   The reason why this <span class="red">gadget</span> works this way lies in the equation of the paÂ­raboloid and the fact that every section cut from a paraboloid, like a, b, c, d, e, is a parabola and all are identical.â€

  â€œHow much more Know-How is needed to make human life obsolete?  Is there any known <span class="red">gadget</span> for controlling a rampant Know-How?  The lady in the ad has found a mechanic substitute for moral choice?â€  â€œAs the ad implies, know-how is at once a technical and a moral sphere.  It is a duty for a woman to love her husband and also to love that soap that will make her husband love her.  It is a duty to be glamorous, cheerful, efficient, and, so far as possible, to run the home like an automatic factory.  This ad also draws attention to the tendency of the modern housewife, after a premarital spell in the business world, to embrace marriage and children but not housework.  Emotionally, she repudiates physical tasks with the same confection that she pursues hygiene.  And so the ad promises her a means of doing physical work without hating the husband who has dragged her into household drudgery.  /  To purchase <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that relieve this drudgery and thus promote domestic affection is, therefore, a duty, too.  And so it is that not only labor-saving appliances but food and nylons (â€˜your legs owe it to their audienceâ€™) are consumed and promoted with moral fervor.  /  But <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and gimmicks did not begin as physical objects, nor are they only to be understood as such today.  Benjamin Franklin, protean prototype and professor of know-how, is equally celebrated for both his material and psychological technology.  In his Autobiography, still a central feature of Yankee moral structure, he tells, for example, how he hit upon a system of moral bookkeeping which would enable any man to achieve perfection in several months.  The trick is to select only one fault at a time for deletion and by concentration and persistence the moral slate will soon be clean.  Related to this system was his discovery of various techniques for winning friends and influencing people which are still as serviceable as ever.â€

  â€œAppellee-plaintiffs sued for the infringement of three patents relating to steering gear idler arm assemblies of automobiles. Appellants-defendants,2  asserted that the patents were invalid because of lack of invention and that there was no infringement. The trial court upheld validity, found and enjoined infringement, and ordered an accounting. Later Jamco was found to be in contempt for violation of the injunction.  [â€¦]  [<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> as commonsense solution to a problem:]  Jamco asserts that these devices do not constitute invention, were anticipated by the prior art, and at the most show only mechanical improvements which should have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art.  [â€¦]  The crucial issue is whether â€˜the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.â€™  [â€¦]  The dividing line between what results from mechanical ability and what displays inventive genius is ill-defined. Perhaps no hard and fast definitive rule can or should be established. We have here combination patents utilizing such well and commonly known elements as bearings, grease seals, washers, bushings, nuts and bolts. In Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 151, and 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 129, 95 L.Ed. 162, it was said that â€˜the concept of invention is inherently elusive when applied to combination of old elementsâ€™ and that â€˜courts should scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.â€™  [â€¦] Recognizing that patentability is a question of law for the court,13  we cannot say that here there is a <span class="red">gadget</span> as opposed to an invention. Certainly in a particular environment, the steering mechanism of motor vehicles, the peculiar and difficult problem of stabilizing that mechanism and protecting if from undue wear is solved in an expert, inexpensive and effective manner which attains an improved result. If the distinctive arrangement of the known elements would be apparent to a skilled mechanic, such fact is established neither by an examination of the devices nor by the evidence adduced at the trial. From the record presented to us the novel and distinctive combinations which make up the three patents in question require â€˜greater skill and higher thought than would be expected of an ordinary mechanic trained in the art.â€™14  In the circumstances, Jamco has not sustained the burden of overcoming the presumption of validity by clear and convincing evidence.â€

In Stanhopeâ€™s Demonstrator the middle term was represented by a small wooden panel called the â€œholon.â€ It had a frame through which other panels could be slid to cover all or part of the holon.

  â€œThe <span class="red">Gadget</span> Maker is a 1955 novel by Maxwell Griffith. It is notable for its vivid depiction of an otherwise-rarely-described milieu: campus life at MIT in the 1940s. It also presents a striking engineers-eye-view of guided missile development at a West Coast aerospace firm during the early days of the cold war.  On its appearance, the New York Times described The <span class="red">Gadget</span> Maker as â€œthe story of a misguided zealot devoted body and soul to the advancement of knowledgeâ€ and called it â€œan absorbing narrative [and] a clear presentation of technological subject-matter, written with stylistic ease and fluidity by an author who is himself a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.â€  Just a few phrases in the novel, such as â€œEssentially, engineering was the skilled bending and shaping of metals into airplanes, bridges, cars, <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> galore.  Still, it required more than a skill at fabricationâ€“an understanding, some vital spark of creativeness.â€

  â€œYour issue on automatic control is a vivid portrayal of a materialistic culture in which bright young men study engineering instead of philosophy. Only two authors (the first and last) weigh the tremendous problems that will follow the advances described by the other six. Each of these two speaks with the circumspection of one who elects to drift with the current rather than inquire too critically as to its direction.  Less inhibited philosophersâ€“say Bertrand Russell, Karl Menninger, Julian Huxley, Henry Thoreau and Philip Wylieâ€“have been genuinely worried that so much genius is directed at producing more and better <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> rather than improving the aims, morals and happiness of man himÂ­ self, a field commonly left to opportunists and superstition-mongers. Is it not cause for alarm that Nobelists in peaceÂ­ unlike those in physics or medicineÂ­ have often been conspicuous only by their absence? Or that such a basic human urge as pride of achievement (the family piano) is steadily giving ground to pride of ownership (the family television)?â€  â€œ

  â€œModel Jets and Rockets for Boys, by Raymond F. Yates. Harper &amp; Brothers ($2.50).

  <strong>Weaver, Warren, 1955.</strong>
  â€œI do have some familiarity with modern high speed computing devices and other optical-electronic-mechanical techniques for handling information; and I have had some contacts withâ€“and surely a lively interest inâ€“the recent developments of communication theoryâ€ (613).  The â€œpatent office problemâ€ is, to Weaver, â€œa fascinating instance of a rather common modern dilemma, namely, the essential collapse of a communication network due to over-complication; or somewhat more precisely, due to the use of an outmoded procedure which is not capable of coping with the presently existing degree of complication.  This is, in fact, a dramatic instance of the situation not uncommon in the general world of scholarship, in which a vast and intricate tangle of documents gets jammed into an unusable pile between two mindsâ€ (613).  â€œThere are slightly less than three million U.S. Patents.  If we add the foreign patents and the items of technical literature available in the Patent Office, the total swells to about seven million.  The corresponding figure was only 1.2 million in 1900; and the patents of today average about one-third longer, and are certainly much more complex in their technical and scientific detail.  In the terminology of modern communications theory, in which a â€˜bitâ€™ of information is the basic unit (essentially the answer to a single â€˜Yes-Noâ€™ question), the total amount of information which must today be dealt with in the Patent office has been estimated to be of the order of fifty billion bits [CONVERT 50 BILLION BITS TO GB?  1 million GB?  =  1,000 TB?] (614).  Goes on to survey different kinds of â€œmechanical aids to data handling.â€  /  A question of classification â€“ beginning to work out the dimensions of a relational database:  â€œWhen does a Document A exhibit inhibitory relevance to another Document B?â€ (619).  * * * Is it unreasonable to think that, if one just looks deep enough with trained and observant eyes, he might see an inner logical simplicity behind all the confusing proliferation of things and ideas that turn up in the Patent Office?  Just because of its emphasis on inner logical simplicity, and on generality to encompass multiplicity, the point of view of mathematics would seem to be the promising one here.  How, for example, does one ever define â€˜containersâ€™ in the everyday nouns and adjectives of commerce in a way which is at once simple enough, general enough, and critical enough so that can possibly cope with the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> someone will think of tomorrow?  But what object can anyone ever think up that will not be subject to the basic inner concepts of connectivity as they are developed in topology?â€ (621-2)  Biological metaphor for an â€œorganic sortâ€ of classification system, â€œFor it must be able to grow and to adjust itself to an ever changing environment.â€  (622).  â€œI realize that I have succeeded in defining, in impersonal terms, Professor John von Neumann; and I also realize that the Atomic Energy Commission has him all booked up at the moment.  But at least he proves that such leadership is not unthinkable.â€ (623)â€

  â€œOne section titled: â€œMechanization of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and guns.â€  â€œThis was a period when inventors multiplied U.S. manpowerâ€“and womanpowerâ€“many times with devices which mechanized routine tasks.

The cherry pitter was a crank-turned kitchen <span class="red">gadget</span> which cleaned a cupful of fruit in about the same time.â€  on the sewing machine:  â€œAny of these household <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> could have been made in 1500, insofar as their mechanical principles were concerned.

  ** Goerger, Orville, 1955.**
  â€œOrville Goerger is Copy Director of Commerical Letter, Inc., a St. Louis mail-advertising agency.  But in addition to carrying on his regular work, he plays an important part in many â€˜extracurricular activitiesâ€™ that manifest his deep interest in direct mail.  He is also guest lecturer on direct-mail copy at Washington University and St. Louis University; contributor of direct-mail articles to various trade publications; creator of award-winning <span class="red">gadget</span> campaigns in the Direct-mail Advertising Associationâ€™s annual competition; member of the Board of Governors, Advertising Club of St. Louis; and Chairman of the Skit-Writing Committee for the Advertising Clubâ€™s annual Gridiron Dinnerâ€ (210).  â€œAll too often the direct-mail user planning a <span class="red">gadget</span> mailing spends most of his planning time looking for a <span class="red">gadget</span> that is new, different, and unusual.  /  Yet mere newness is not always a guarantee of resultfulness.  Nor is the complexity or elaborate nature of the <span class="red">gadget</span> any measure of the success it will achieve.  Indeed, in many cases, best results are obtained when a relatively old idea is dug out and re-used.  /  â€œThis may be a bit hard to believe in these days when many of the new letter <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> rival the atom bomb in their complexity.  There are rubber-band-powered butterflies that spring out of a letter when it is opened, secret chemical processes that do magical things to a mailing piece when water is applied, Rube Goldberg mechanisms that build elaborate pop-ups when the mailing is unfoldedâ€“and literally hundreds of others.  All are ingenious and do attract a large degree of attention.  /  Yet, surprisingly enough, their effectiveness is sometimes less than that of a relatively simple <span class="red">gadget</span> like, for example, a burnt match.  Both in the cost of the <span class="red">gadget</span> and in the result it secures, the simple <span class="red">gadget</span> frequently outscores its more expensive and elaborate brother.  /  Perhaps the reason for this is that the idea behind the <span class="red">gadget</span>â€™s use is more important than the <span class="red">gadget</span> itself [ital. in original].  In fact, a too elaborate <span class="red">gadget</span> will usually overpower the copy; the reader remembers the <span class="red">gadget</span>, but the message of the mailing piece may never register with him.  /  One cardinal rule for using a <span class="red">gadget</span> is to keep the <span class="red">gadget</span> secondary in importance to the theme of the mailing piece.  It is obviously difficult to do this when the <span class="red">gadget</span> you are using is deliberately designed to dominate the mailing.  /  Another good rule for <span class="red">gadget</span> usage is to keep the <span class="red">gadget</span> merely a stepping stone into the copy.  A good <span class="red">gadget</span> is one that provides an interesting introduction to your message; it is a master of ceremonies whose duty it is to build up the real star of the show â€“ your copy.  A good <span class="red">gadget</span> never steals the show from the star or makes that star seem insignificant by comparison.  The more sensational you make your <span class="red">gadget</span>, the more difficult you make it for your copy message to hold its own.  /  Usually both of these objectives can be achieved by using a <span class="red">gadget</span> or novelty effect of a simple sort.  When a simple <span class="red">gadget</span> is used, you are literarily forced into developing a powerful idea for tying in your message.  In most cases a powerful idea plus the appeal of a good <span class="red">gadget</span> is almost certain to click.â€  The seven <span class="red">gadget</span> ideas are: â€œa penny <span class="red">gadget</span>,â€ literally a penny in the envelope; A piece of string, â€œOne reason for its appeal is that it permits motion in the mailing; by fastening only one end of the string, the other end swings freely and catches the eyeâ€;  a feather; the â€œburnt-edge letter,â€ â€œwhile not strictly a <span class="red">gadget</span>, the burnt-edge letter is so dramatic and so simple that it should not be overlooked when it fits your schemeâ€; cotton; postage stamp, so that â€œpeople are getting something for nothingâ€; miniature photographâ€

  <strong>Cohen, I. Bernard, 1955.</strong>
  â€œAs I returned to the study MIss Dukas explained to me that Eric Rogers, who teaches physics at Princeton, had made a <span class="red">gadget</span> for Einstein as a present for his 76th birthday, and that Professor Einstein had been delighted with it.  Back in  the  study,  I  saw  Einstein  take  from the  corner  of  the  room what  looked  like a  curtain  rod  five  feet  tall,  at  the  top  of which  was  a  plastic  sphere about  four inches  in diameter. Coming  up  from  the rod  into  the  sphere  was  a  small  plastic tube  about  two  inches  long,  terminating in  the  center  of  the  sphere.  Out  of  this tube there came a string with a little ball at  the  end.  â€œYou  see,â€  said  Einstein, â€œthis  is  designed  as  a  model  to  illustrate the  equivalence  principle. The  little  ball is  attached  to  a  string,  which  goes  into the  little  tube  in  the  center  and  is  atÂ­tached  to  a  spring.  The  spring  pulls  on the  ball,  but   it  cannot  pull the ball up and  into  the  little  tube  because  the spring  is  not  strong  enough  to  overcome the  gravitational  force which pulls down on the ball.â€ A  big  grin  spread  across his face  and  his  eyes  twinkled  with  delight as  he  said:  â€œAnd  now  the  equivalence principle.â€  Grasping  the  <span class="red">gadget</span>  in  the middle  of  the  long  brass  curtain  rod,  he thrust it upward until the sphere touched the  ceiling.  â€œNow  I  will  let  it  drop,â€  he said,  â€œand  according  to  the  equivalence principle  there  will  be  no  gravitational force.  So  the  spring  will  now  be  strong enough  to  bring  the  little  ball  into  the plastic  tube.â€  With  that  he  suddenly  let the  <span class="red">gadget</span>  fall  freely  and  vertically, guiding it with his hand, until the bottom reached  the  floor.  The  plastic  sphere  at the  top  was  now  at  eye  level.  Sure enough, the ball nestled in the tube.â€

  â€œJust where the first use in libraries of mechanical trivia was made is no doubt, thoroughly documented in the literature.  Quite possibly, the first â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>â€™ to gain general acceptance was some device as simple but as effective as the rubber date stamp.  Clipped to the end of a pencil, this little gem has has saved thousands of man-hours, and assisted in relegating â€˜library scriptâ€™ to the category of interesting leftovers in the card catalogs of university libraries. [â€¦] the machines and devices which are to be discussed here are those which may be regarded as simple extensions of the hander mind and which are designed to speed some operation or to relieve muscular strain, but not those intended to alter substantially the methods commonly used in libraries.  /  The common aim in introducing tools or machines into almost any process is to reduce the time or energy required to perform some operation or to produce a more uniformly satisfactory result.  To stick to this rule in the application of what may be referred to as â€˜<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>â€™ is sometimes difficult; many of these devices have a kind of fascination for some librarians which occasionally obscures the true economics of their applicationâ€ (239).  â€œThe popularity of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is attested to by the space allotted to them in such professional journals as the A.L.A. Bulletin [the â€œ<span class="red">Gadget</span>s, Gismos, and Gimmicksâ€ column], the Library Journal and PNLA Quarterly in the form of regular columns or departments and of articles proclaiming the success of their various applications.  A few examples of the types of items escrowed briefly in the PNLA Quarterly for January 1956 are: visible files, copying machines, paper cutter, copy follower, and routing forms.

  â€œBut it may also be due to the style of the book. This  is  more  journalistic  than  literary, and sometimes the choice of words is not too  particular.  For  example,  it  quotes Samuel Butler to the effect that the â€œhen is  the  eggâ€™s  device  for  laying  another egg.â€ Now what  Samuel  Butler  actually said,  at least in his  Life and Habit,  was something different,  namely,  that â€œa hen is  only  an  eggâ€™s  way  of making  another egg.â€  He  was  worrying  about  hens  not as <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, but as individuals. The lapse is  an interesting  one,  an intimation that in  the  authorsâ€™  minds  problems  of  inÂ­dividuality belong to the  19th century of the  old-fashioned  nature  rather  than  to the 20th century of population  genetics. Yet the paradox remains that the fascinaÂ­tion of biology to the novice as well as to the  specialist depends even  now  on  the relationship  of  the  individual  to  his group,  and  not  on  considerations  of  the group alone.â€

  â€œThe wonderfully imaginative and often fantastic world of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> was unfolded last week in the New York Trade Show Building, with more than 140 exhibitors taking part.  This was the second such effort promoted by a group of businessmen and managed by Hal Sommers, and the number of inventions aimed at simplifying everyday tasks came within a shade of doubling the total exhibited last year.  <span class="red">Gadget</span>s have always held a fascination for the man on the street and his better half.  Among the items which have been surefire crowd stoppers in the past are the little gimmicksâ€“the better mousetrap, so to speakâ€“which show at a glance how to do something quicker and cleaner.  Some of those shown in New York, however, are a bit obscure as far as practical purpose is concerned, but they still are interesting enough to win attention.  â€¦  The <span class="red">Gadget</span> Show was initiated last year as a showplace for thousands of unknown innovations that flow from the American inventive mind.

  â€œSince considerable heat (ill-wind) can be created thru poor presentations, sloppy work and phony items, it was editable that a <span class="red">gadget</span> workersâ€™ protective organization make an appearance.  The new non-profit Exhibitors Association of America, headquartered in California, has been incorporated with the avowed aim of stopping unfair practices bothy by and against demonstrators.  It would improve the level of the demonstration industry and protect it from space rent and percentage gouging.  /  The person working <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is all things to all viewers, wherever the public congregates.  If they want humor he has it; the same goes for the many other qualities necessary to successful entertainment on a personnel level.  It is so personal, in fact, that unlike high paid public performers, the <span class="red">gadget</span> workerâ€™s immediate audience rarely numbers more than three dozen people and is no more than 12 feet from him.  If he is a top-notcher, however, he could get 75 per cent of his tip (audience) to vote him into Congress as easily as spring (spend) for a sale.  /  Basically speaking, the new and novel item is a traffic-stopper, enabling the demonstrator to build his tip.  He presents it in a [sic] appealing way through humor, stories, etc., hooding his tipâ€™s attention while presenting the item.  Then comes his close (windup) and the request for sales.  Then comes a rehash of his spiel to convince additional viewers who have not sprung and also to hold the tip, which in itself is a good way to stop more traffic as passers-by gather to see whatâ€™s going on.  /  The business is a small one and far from the usual housewares salesmanship.  It has workers (commission agents) who act for the leaders, those pace-setters in the field.  There are independents, who do their own buying and renting of space, and who work alone except for an occasional partner or member of the family.  /  The fieldâ€™s code of ethics is not one that a banker would follow.  It is generally a cash-on-the-line business, but it is not improper to owe money for merchandise when one is tapped out (broke), but eventual payment is a must if a worker expects to last in the industry.  Demonstrators playing a red one (successful fair date or celebration) are prone to help out another clansman by lending money or merchandise.  Credit information is entirely word of mouth, however, and reputations are soon established for honesty and reliability.  /  Altho most demonstrators work on limited capital a great deal of money can be made quickly and lost just as fast, in the trade.  Experience brings with it the ability to judge the quality and potential earnings of a location, and the knack of securing an occasional ex for <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> at certain fairs, on traveling shows, and at stores.  Sometimes a respected worker can control all <span class="red">gadget</span> locations on a fairground by proving his competence to the fair secretary.  /  There is considerable disillusionment in the business,w which is constantly having its personnel weeded out as johnny-come-latelys fold up at the first sign of hardship.  Old-timers know, tho that rainy days soon pass, and when they do, the clan is busy at work building more tips and pocketing the profits.â€

  â€œthe world of kitchen <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is never in finer fettle than during the fair season, when <span class="red">gadget</span> workers have already been pulling in cash at boardwalk stands, department stores and farmers markets.  This peculiar form of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> is aimed right at the women, and in the hands of capable workers, it hardly ever misses its mark.  /  During good times and bad there has always been a call for <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  They make their mark, last in popularity for a cycle of three years, more or less, then seemingly die as quickly as they were born.  But this is more a hibernation than death, since in kitchen <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> as in many other merchandising fields, old objects are frequently born over again and ride high on a new wave of popularity.  /  For example: 20 years ago a big item on boardwalks was the combination peeler-slicer, which both peeled and cored fruit such as apples, as well as scoring corn and being useful as a slicer.  That was 20 years ago, and itâ€™s on the scene again.  /  For example:  Three years ago, choppers became a hot item, starting with a Swiss import retailing at $1.98.  American versions, like Rotomatic and Chopomatic, competed with the Swiss Blitzhacker.  Price was $2.98.  Mass production overtook the price and stamped it down to $1.98 and even lower in some cases, causing some perplexity by price-conscious demonstrators.  Rotomatic was replaced by the Imperial Food Chopper during this period.  But this price confusion was followed by a waning popularity and it was decided to produce a super model with a bigger bowl, capable of holding more and bigger vegetables and eliminating the need to slice some of them down to chopper size.  Now we have the Grown Imperial.  /  From 1952-â€˜54 the handy little Mouli Grater ($1 retail) nurtured a company which has taken on a wider line of kitchen <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  There is a $2.98 Julienne and $4.98 Salad-Maker (retail).  /  Others among the wide assortment of plastic and metal gizmos directed at the American housewifeâ€“and so artfully demonstrated thruout the landâ€“include a handy radish cutter which creates a radish floweredâ€¦â€  /  * * * â€œ<span class="red">Gadget</span>s used to be set out on counters in cartons, but lately the poly bag has become a common display method.

The basket has come up so strongly that one manufacturer, fearful of rapid over-saturation, is offering a combination package.  This contains the French basket, a pastry maker, and pastrymanâ€™s cloth.  /  But there is virtually no end to the number of handy little <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> offered as time-savers for the American kitchen.  The target is the womenfolk and, praise be, they have responded in admirable fashion for generations, always pushovers for kitchen aids.â€  Later, kinds of objects:  â€œinexpensive tools, â€˜unbreakable combs,â€™ radio station clearing coils, and other inexpensive pieces of merchandise.â€

  â€œTechnological innovations have been as important as language, art and science in distinguishing man from beast.  And although technological innovation antedates our species, it has never before occupied so great a share of manâ€™s energies.  /  Our works are built on old foundationsâ€“â€“on obsolete inventions such as the hand-ax and the bow no less than on inventions that have survived, such as agriculture and the wheel.  But during most of human history technological art accumulated gradually.  Up to a few hundred years ago, the techniques of civilized life had scarcely advanced beyond the best achievements of the ancients.  Then our control over the forces of nature began to increase at an explosive rate.  [â€¦]  In this article we shall examine some recent advances to see what light they throw on the creative process in the complex of technology today.  What do we mean by technological innovation?  Surely not the tail fins on this yearâ€™s automobile, nor a new catch on a refrigerator door.  A true innovation must perform some important function.  It may do a wholly new job or do an old job far better or far more cheaply than it was done before.  [â€¦]  â€¦I will discuss some reasonably noncontroversial innovations made at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, where I am employed, under circumstances which I believe I understand.  [â€¦]  As our final example of innovation in technology let us consider briefly the microwave-relay system which carries telephone conversations and television programs across the country without the use of cables.  The key word here is â€˜system.â€™  The problem was not to make a particular device, but to weld a great number of devices into a complex whole.  Some of the deices were available at the start; others had to be developed.  But the chief innovation was the choice, among the many alternative methods and devices, of the best combination of methods and devicesâ€“the system as a whole, and not merely its adequate parts.  [â€¦]  [Harold T.] Friisâ€™s main problem, then, was not to invent this <span class="red">gadget</span> or that, but to choose the best course, technically and economically, among a bewildering array of possibilities.  The art of making such a choice is usually called systems engineering when the alternative means and the required knowledge are all at hand.  When they are not, I suppose it should be called systems research.  By 1948 the results of the research of Friis and his colleagues had been embodied in an experimental system which was installed between New York and Boston.  This was the prototype of the transcontinental microwave system, which was put into service in 1951.â€

  â€œThe â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>â€™, which is defined by Webster as slang meaning a â€˜mechanical contrivance, a device, or any ingenious articleâ€™ has become a fundamental part of the American scene.â€  â€œOne cannot generalize from the study of these two cases. The psychological mechanisms described need not be characteristic of typical cultural attitudes, although there seems generally to be something derogatory in the use of the term, <span class="red">gadget</span>â€ (339).  â€œThe machine deals with the external world directly and, although there are many exceptions, strives to create order from disorder. One can say that it is similar to a secondary process operation which takes the unorganized and gives it organization. In most cases a human being is required to operate machines. The <span class="red">gadget</span> differs from the complex machine in that it minimizes the importance of the human being whereas the ordinary machine augments a personâ€™s capacity to do work which requires secondary process operations. For example, typewriting is the use of a machine to record ideas which are refined and organized in the process of transmitting them to the machine. The typewriter is thus a mechanical aid to the secondary process operation. The <span class="red">gadget</span>, on the other hand, requires a minimum of human intervention and gives the illusion of operating independently.  /  One cannot conceive of a machine performing secondary process operations independently, because in order to accomplish such a function there must also be a primary process. There are, however, a variety of electronic computers that seem almost to be able to think. Cybernetics, as we all know, has viewed the psychic apparatus in terms analogous to those of an electronic circuit and has caused machines to be built that function in a manner that is analogous to human logic.  /  Both patients stressed that the function of a <span class="red">gadget</span> is secondary in importance to its operation, which obscured its purpose to them. Whether it worked or not, in terms of accomplishing what it is supposed to do, was a minor consideration. This does not mean that the <span class="red">gadget</span> did not have to work perfectly in a mechanical sense, because if it did not the <span class="red">gadget</span>eer would be frustrated. What it did mean, to both the patients, was that the human appreciation of what the <span class="red">gadget</span> accomplishes, for example, reproduction of music in such a way as to provide a gratifying and moving experience, tended to take second place in their minds to a pleasure in the operation of the <span class="red">gadget</span> itself.â€ (336).  â€œCommon among all the patients in this group was anger toward the <span class="red">gadget</span> and the â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>eerâ€™. To define these terms for the purpose of this paper is not easy. Any technological device, especially when first introduced, can be considered a <span class="red">gadget</span>. These patients for the most part objected to two aspects of these devices which may be classified as follows. First, the regulation of time as in switches with either an automatic control or a feed-back mechanism to interrupt a circuit and turn something off or on. Included were such items as furnace controls, coffee makers, and radio switches that turn other mechanisms on and off. Second, enhancement of passivity. In this class can be included practically all objects that do work, and consequently permit more leisure. Automatic dishwashers, automatic transmissions in automobiles, and, especially, remote control of television without getting up from oneâ€™s armchair are a threat because of the enhancement of passivity.  Television itself was scorned by one patient who nevertheless succumbed to its lure and then watched it for hours every night. One patient was particularly chagrined to learn there was a switch that automatically controls a fan for ventilating a house, depending on the amount of heat in the attic. That it required a minimum of human intervention for its operation was what this patient found most disturbing.  /  This classification is sketchy and not technologically precise. As it is manifestly impossible to state definitely where invention ends and <span class="red">gadget</span>eering begins, it is striking that these patients frequently made such arbitrary distinctions. Patients pointed out that function was of little importance; the operation of the <span class="red">gadget</span> was the primary feature. One patient spoke with anger of persons who were more interested in the tonal qualities of complex high fidelity sets than in the music. He referred to a recent joke of a person who contented himself with studying the wave patterns produced by an oscillograph hooked into the system.â€  (330)  Catalogues patients who can only appreciate photographs and not painting for instance, appreciating technical perfection over beauty.  â€œIn these instances, it is the person who is ingenious, not the machine; and such a person strives to be capable of accomplishing almost anything. The omnipotent qualities of such fantasies are extremely valuable in enhancing narcissism. Such a fantasy, especially when it is as compulsive as it was in both these patients, serves as a narcissistic, omnipotent, magical defense against the inner awareness of a weak and constricted egoâ€ (339).  â€œTo this artist, as it was to the scientist, the <span class="red">gadget</span> served as an intensive means of communicating with reality.â€  â€œIn both these patients, the <span class="red">gadget</span> was not only a factor that represented the operation of the secondary process, which is in opposition to instinctual forces, but, more specifically, it was a factor in preserving identity. In the first case, there was a direct correlation between the patientâ€™s interest in <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and security in his identity. In the second case, there seemed to be an inverse correlation; greater preoccupation with the <span class="red">gadget</span> threatened the patientâ€™s ego ideal, and made him feel less secure of his identity.â€

  â€œA  case  history  of a  schizophrenic  child  who  converted  himself into  a  â€œmachineâ€  because  he  did  not  dare  be  human.  His  story sheds  light  on  emotional  development  in  a  mechanized  society.  [â€¦]  To counteract this fear we gave him a metal wastebasket in lieu of a toilet.  Eventually, when eliminating into the wastebasket, he no longer needed to take off all his clothes, nor to hold on to the wall.  He still needed the tubes and motors which, he believed, moved his bowels for him.  But here again the all-important machinery was itself a source of new terrors.  In Joeyâ€™s world the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> had to move their bowels, too.  He was terribly concerned that they should, but since they were so much more powerful than men, he was also terrified that if his tubes moved their bowels, their feces would fill all of space and leave no room to live.  He was thus always caught in some fearful contradiction.â€
