  <strong>Brown, Robert, 1886.</strong>
  ‚ÄúThen the names of all the other things on board a ship! I don‚Äôt know half of them yet; even the sailors forget at times, and if the exact name of anything they want happens to slip from their memory, they call it a chicken~fixing, or a <span class="red">gadjet</span>, or a gill-guy, or a timmey-noggy, or a wim-womjust pro tem., you know.‚Äù

  <strong>Lees, J.A. and Clutterbuck, W.J., 1888.</strong>
  ‚ÄúSo we gaily essayed the passage, which Jim accomplished safely; but just as the Skipper was stepping off his bridge on to the bank the treacherous bark gave way (this is the worst danger in walking on fallen trees), and with a mighty splash he and his rifle went into the deepest hole in the creek.  He thought it best to get out at once, but too late to save his watch, which he opened, and found that the escapement had floated round to the back of the mainspring and jammed the <span class="red">gadget</span> that the chunkerblock would not work.  But we were equal to the emergency, and in two minutes had frizzled all the water out of the works by unscrewing the large lens of the binocular and using it as a burning glass.  It had a wonderful effect, and with a little coaxing the watch began to go; then we hung it on a tree with the mechanism still exposed to the rays of the sun, and went on our way rejoicing.‚Äù
