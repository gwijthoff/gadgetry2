  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œI think that many an officer, when he first studies the mooring board at the Naval Academy, or rather when he is supposed to study it, is at once impressed with its resemblance to a huge spider web, contrived by the devilish ingenuity of man for the purpose of hopelessly enmeshing the poor flyâ€“which is himself.  [â€¦]  In either case, if the ship has to shift berth, the tendency is to damn the mooring board as an impracticable â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>,â€™ and to fail to criticize the manner of its use.  Thus when it comes to a consideration of the less obvious manuvering problems, he is prone to dismiss the whole matter with the assertion tha, like the Peace of God, it â€˜passeth all understanding.â€™  [â€¦]  When speaking of mooring board problems, I think not so much of the board itself as of the kind of work involved.  Such problems may be worked out on the actual board, or in many cases on a chart, or perhaps on some kind of specially contrived â€˜<span class="red">gadget</span>.â€™ [â€¦]  I have a <span class="red">gadget</span> I use for maneuvering problems instead of the printed forms, locally known as the â€˜Wegee Board,â€™ because it is supposed to predict the future and explain the past.  It is a sheet of white celluloid with an 18â€circle on it graduated in degrees.  At the center is the point of a thumb tack inserted from the bottom side and filed down till it barely projects above the board.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œAn Industrial Expert Tells Why Manufacturers Must Seek New Inventions to Keep Their Wheels Turning.  [â€¦]  â€œâ€˜Our experience with inventors and with manufacturers indicates that there is a tremendous amount of inventive effort going to waste.  A great deal of free-lance inventing means that the poor inventor spends a vast amount of time and thought and often hard-earned savings working up some useless <span class="red">gadget</span> that nobody will have.  â€œThe inventor must realize that the first requisite of any new invention is that there be a possibility of broad human need underlying it, and maÂ­ chinery for its distribution that can be made to turn without spending a small fortune.        Let him remember the really outstanding inventions and think of them not as mechanical creations but as things that made it possible for humanity to ride where it had walked; to bridge space with conversation where it formerly required days to transmit messages.  /  Let him remember Gilletteâ€™s safety razor. The money on this invention has been made not through the razor but the blades.  /  Gilletteâ€™s fundaÂ­mental idea from which that invention sprung was that he wanted to get something for which there would be unÂ­ limited repeat business. His hitting upon a blade that could be used and thrown away was a real stroke of genius.  /  This element of need is the thing that has been fundamental in inventions which have won commercial success.  Before he spends a lot of time, therefore, let the inventor check up on the potential market.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œIn reading through â€œthe glossy pages of a large and costly monthlyâ€ magazineâ€¦  â€œIn absorbed fascination I read these slyly contrived proffering of wares, and I became aware as I read these slyly contrived profferings of wares, and I became aware, as I read, that almost all the advertised productsâ€“although as physically various as ice-boxes and pens, underwear and cigar-lightersâ€“had a certain common aspect.  Almost all of them, in a word, were <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  /  A <span class="red">gadget</span> is not easy to define.  It is a kind of whatâ€™s or thingumabob or dingusâ€“all these excellent slang words being themselves, alas, rather nebulous and indefinable.  The fact that it is indefinable may be, I suspect, the clue to the <span class="red">gadget</span>â€™s nature.  The <span class="red">gadget</span>, in short, is a <span class="red">gadget</span>; which is to say that it is not definable in terms of its relation to the real life and basic pursuits of man.  A â€˜hatâ€™ we may define; it is an object to keep the human head warm or dry or shaded or otherwise comfortable.  We may readily enough define food or drink or books or houses.  But the <span class="red">gadget</span>â€¦â€ (590) / â€œI hear complaints and repinings now and again that in this age philosophy is dead.  But I do not think so.  There has simply been substituted, for other philosophies, the philosophy of the <span class="red">gadget</span>.  This philosophy is but materialism carried to a somewhat attenuated but entirely logical extreme.  It is the ultimate, and rather pathetic, expression of acquisitiveness.  [â€¦]  We have deified <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, precisely as we have tended more and more to make material concerns for ultimates of our thinking.  For that modern temper which delights â€˜to pay devout and uncritical obeisance to the analytic intelligence,â€™ disclaiming every other human faculty of apprehension, and whichâ€“being beset by economic woesâ€“is obsessed by economic criteria of values, and by those alone, it would be hard to find a more fitting symbol and insignia than The <span class="red">Gadget</span>.â€  â€œThat we seek to appease this gnawing sense of want and incompleteness by devising newer and queerer and more elaborate <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is not more ridiculous than sad.  It is part of the flight from reality, or rather, perhaps, of the refusal to face reality steadfastly and with full realization.â€  Goes to a â€œdream of some day about the year 5000â€ when archaeologists explore â€œthe subterranean ruins of a great twentieth-century city,â€ uncovering miserable tabloids chronicling war, â€œnight clubs,â€ and the horrors ofâ€¦ ::gasp:: stand up comedy!  â€œAnd then, in this dream, I see the leader of the archaeological party pounce with delight upon a small object in the dust, and I hear him cry â€˜Here is their sacred talisman, the symbol of their religion!â€™ and I see him hold up to his conferÃ¨res a cigar-lighter with the recipes for eight cocktails printed on it, and with a fountain-pen at one end of it and a flashlight at the other.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œDuring the few months of delay required by Henry to get his factory force and his advertising force and his sales force organized, expectation and curiosity rose high.  Nobody knew what the <span class="red">gadget</span> was to be, except that it was rumored that it was to be extremely <span class="red">gadget</span>ish.  Henry, in the meantime, cleverly whetted the public curiosity by putting up along the most frequented monkey-paths in the jungle signs such as these:  BRING SUNSHINE IN TO THE FAMILY NEXT / BUY A GADGET â€“ AND IT DOES THE REST.  A COCOANUT, A COCOANUT, A COCOANUT A DAY / WILL BUY YOUR WIFE A GADGET AND KEEP THE FROWNS AWAY.â€  turns out to be a cocoanut opener:  â€œThe Guenon Perfection Automatic Cocoanut Decapitator.â€  â€œIt was so much more esthetic to have neatly decapitated cocoanuts, instead of the old kind that merely had their tops bashed in with a rock, that no self-respecting monkey-family dared serve any other kind.  And besides that, the <span class="red">gadget</span> was such fun to play with.  Many a previously-industrious husband would stay at home half the morning fooling with the Decapitator when he ought to have been out picking cocoanuts for the support of his family.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œOur monumental work on the Theory of <span class="red">Gadget</span>s which has been, as they say, on the stocks for twenty years, is nearing completion.  But so, apparently, is civilization [gallows humor in the lead-up to warâ€¦].  And in case our publication date does not succeed in anticipating the final crash of Armageddon, we would like to give you a few hints of what these volumes would have contained.  /  Everybody knows what a <span class="red">gadget</span> is, and yet a definition is hard to find.  After deep thought, we give you this:  A <span class="red">gadget</span> is anything which, designed to simplify life, actually complicates it.  We are fully aware that this definition is almost revolutionary in its comprehensiveness.  Yet it is tenable.  It includes everything from a battleship to a fountain pen.  It includes the cigarette lighter that is always running dry, the electric icebox that springs a sulphur leak when eight guests are waiting for cocktails, the automatic shocke that saves two seconds in starting your car every day for thirty days, and on the thirty-first robs you of two hours of your time and two dollars of your money.  It includes most of the things you give your friends for Christmas, And [sic] all that you get.  /  In our chapter on Man and the <span class="red">Gadget</span>, we show how man, the eternal sucker, progresses from enthusiasm to disillusion, repeatedly, all his life longâ€“for the <span class="red">gadget</span> has no experience value.  Elsewhere we estimate the time and money spent on the invention, manufacture, sale, operation, and final frenzied destruction of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  We list al known <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, showing the difference between promise and performance.  And finally, we paint a picture of a <span class="red">gadget</span>-less Utopia, with a few practical hints on how to attain it.  /  The difficulty in completing this work has been in our <span class="red">gadget</span>-testing department.  For obviously, if a single <span class="red">gadget</span> is really found to simplify life, it nullifies our whole argument.  And new <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> appear daily.  We were ready this morning to write finisâ€“when we read of the new false teeth plates which have magnets set in them, with like poles opposing, to keep upper and lower plates apart and in place.  We have always insisted on doing all testing ourself.  Yet we still retain most of our original teeth, and are reluctant to sacrifice them, even to add the final proof to our theory.  For if the magnets donâ€™t work, we have, it is true, the proof, but are just where we were before, and with nothing to chew with.  And if they do work, a lifetime of effort is undone.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œOur man in charge of detecting trade-marks reports a wide-spread craze for compounds ending in â€œmatic.â€  The word â€˜automaticâ€™ is presumably the father to these coinages, since they all seem intended to carry a connotation of self-propulsion.  It is not a new idea.  Oil-O-Matic, which may have been the first, has been the trade-mark for the Williams oil burner for a number of years.  Within the last twelve months or so, however, the style has suddenly and for no apparent reason become extravagantly popular.  /  The automobile industry has been particularly prolific along these lines.  One manufacturer feathers the Hydramatic drive, another the Electromatic clutch, another Powermatic shifting, a fourth the Simplimatic transmission.  The newest models bring the Liquimatic drive and the Turbo-matic drive.  /  The vogue is also extensive in the electrical appliance field.  Examples include the Vis-O-Matic, Aire-Matic and Attach-O-Matic sweepers; the Laundrimatic, Spira-Matic and ABC-O-Matic washers; the Electro-Matic and Touch-O-Matic radios.  There is a Tel-A-Matic iron, and also an Adjust-O-Matic and a Steam-O-Matic.  The Ade-O-Matic keeps things warm on the Center-Matic stove while the Coffeematic processes the java.  Workers in industry ply Multi-matic and Camatic tools, while the Shift-o-matic is an electric typewriter carriage return.  /  Miscellaneous adaptations privilege the consumer to ride on Seal-O-Matic inner tubes; to sit hygienically in a Postur-Matic chair; to wear Glide-O-Matic arch resters while pushing a baby cab equipped with an Adjustmatic gear.  Whatâ€™s more you can painlessly purchase any or all of the above articles on the Buy-O-Matic loan plan.  And if there is anything left for taxes, you can figure the amount with the Tax-O-Matic income tax chart.  /  It could have been considered inevitable that somebody would come up with Matho-Matic.  Sure enough, somebody did.  Itâ€™s the name for the nozzle on the Premier vacuum cleaner.  So far as we know, Roomatic remains unclaimed.  /  P.S.  At this very moment, Junior may be at large with the recently introduced Squirt-O-Matic water pistol.â€

When Don Davis of the <span class="red">Gadget</span>-of-the-Month Club of Los Angeles, Calif., which sends a gimmick monthly to half a million subscribers, handed Webb the enigmatic tubular gizmo shown here, Webb was nonplused.  Nevertheless he accepted the challenge of figuring out what it was.  For 20 minutes he struggled manfully to make it do something useful without ever tumbling to its real purpose.  He twisted it and turned it, applying it to various parts of his anatomy with no success.  Finaly he even tried to make it fit his dog.  Then, baffled and frustrated, he gave up.  But Webb did learn the doodadâ€™s proper use eventually, just as can anyone else by turning the page.â€ â€¦ â€œItâ€™s a bathtub cane to prevent oldsters, cripples and cautious people from slipping.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œYour issue on automatic control is a vivid portrayal of a materialistic culture in which bright young men study engineering instead of philosophy. Only two authors (the first and last) weigh the tremendous problems that will follow the advances described by the other six. Each of these two speaks with the circumspection of one who elects to drift with the current rather than inquire too critically as to its direction.  Less inhibited philosophersâ€“say Bertrand Russell, Karl Menninger, Julian Huxley, Henry Thoreau and Philip Wylieâ€“have been genuinely worried that so much genius is directed at producing more and better <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> rather than improving the aims, morals and happiness of man himÂ­ self, a field commonly left to opportunists and superstition-mongers. Is it not cause for alarm that Nobelists in peaceÂ­ unlike those in physics or medicineÂ­ have often been conspicuous only by their absence? Or that such a basic human urge as pride of achievement (the family piano) is steadily giving ground to pride of ownership (the family television)?â€  â€œ

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œIt is the willingness to sacrifice that forces itself on our attention at this time. Like all Americans, we seem too anxious to buy <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and conveniences that we should do without. All too many of the oppressed of the earth use such conveniences as opiates. A group of people that are always the last hired, the first fired, and are always relegated to the least desirable jobs, should be careful how they spend their money when they get it.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œTechnological innovations have been as important as language, art and science in distinguishing man from beast.  And although technological innovation antedates our species, it has never before occupied so great a share of manâ€™s energies.  /  Our works are built on old foundationsâ€“â€“on obsolete inventions such as the hand-ax and the bow no less than on inventions that have survived, such as agriculture and the wheel.  But during most of human history technological art accumulated gradually.  Up to a few hundred years ago, the techniques of civilized life had scarcely advanced beyond the best achievements of the ancients.  Then our control over the forces of nature began to increase at an explosive rate.  [â€¦]  In this article we shall examine some recent advances to see what light they throw on the creative process in the complex of technology today.  What do we mean by technological innovation?  Surely not the tail fins on this yearâ€™s automobile, nor a new catch on a refrigerator door.  A true innovation must perform some important function.  It may do a wholly new job or do an old job far better or far more cheaply than it was done before.  [â€¦]  â€¦I will discuss some reasonably noncontroversial innovations made at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, where I am employed, under circumstances which I believe I understand.  [â€¦]  As our final example of innovation in technology let us consider briefly the microwave-relay system which carries telephone conversations and television programs across the country without the use of cables.  The key word here is â€˜system.â€™  The problem was not to make a particular device, but to weld a great number of devices into a complex whole.  Some of the deices were available at the start; others had to be developed.  But the chief innovation was the choice, among the many alternative methods and devices, of the best combination of methods and devicesâ€“the system as a whole, and not merely its adequate parts.  [â€¦]  [Harold T.] Friisâ€™s main problem, then, was not to invent this <span class="red">gadget</span> or that, but to choose the best course, technically and economically, among a bewildering array of possibilities.  The art of making such a choice is usually called systems engineering when the alternative means and the required knowledge are all at hand.  When they are not, I suppose it should be called systems research.  By 1948 the results of the research of Friis and his colleagues had been embodied in an experimental system which was installed between New York and Boston.  This was the prototype of the transcontinental microwave system, which was put into service in 1951.â€

It takes 67 million of us to keep industry and commerce spinning. / This thought was brought home to me a few weekends ago when I took my car to Joeâ€™s garage. Iâ€™ve been doing business with Joe for 15 years. In that time, his garage has changed considerably. At the beginning, Joe had only a grease pit and a hydraulic lift. Today, he has a battery of machines and meters he uses in diagnosing my carâ€™s ills. / On this business of automation I asked Joe if servicing my car hadnâ€™t become a lot easier with the â€œ<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>â€ he now had. / Of course, Joe said. These new devices helped since automobile machinery has become so highly complex. But he told me that there wasnâ€™t one thing any machine could do for my car if he didnâ€™t stay abreast of automotive servicing techniques. â€¦ I also realize that all the automation in the world canâ€™t do the job without <em>him.</em> It made me realize that no electronic brain could ever replace my mechanicâ€™s horsepower horse sense.â€

We only know that we buy it at the super market for $1.29 and it has a life expectancy at peak performance of about six weeks. / After that, it takes a Hercules to get the thing to sink its teeth in a can, and then to cling while we laboriously turn the handle, hoping the teeth donâ€™t get tired and ease their bite until the circle is completed. . . . And then, what happens? The top sinks down into the peach or pineapple juice to come to rest right on top of the fruit. . . . whereupon we have to perform an engineering feat with a knife or a fork to get it up out of the can, again. [â€¦] For it will become undoubtedly crystal clear to Nikita after he has toured the United States that American consumption of twice as much meat as the Russians has turned them into a lot of meatheads. . . . And then he will go home and release the necessary number of farm hands to build better moons and rockets, also can openers, and other <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, and thus, move the date for outstripping the U.

It is one thing to be irritated by certain manifestations of our contemporary civilization? the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, the chrome, the tailfins, and the activities that go with them. It is quite another? and something of a non sequitur? to conclude from this that the only alternative to foolish private spending is public spending. Better private spending is just as much of a possibility. My contention here will he that to talk in terms of â€œ public vs. private â€œ is to confuse the issue. More than that, it is to confuse means and ends.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThe situation is particularly alarming in view of the vested  interests  that already exist  with  respect  to  the  development and sale of privacy-invading devices and procedures.  Perhaps  even  more  alarmÂ­ing  are  two  attitudes  that,  it  seems  to me, underlie  the speed with which some of  the  privacy-invading  practices have taken  root, and  that  are  likely  to  be  the basis for a continuing demand for them. The first attitude can be characterized as an infatuation with <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and procedures that appear, at least to the layman, to be scientific.  This attitude seems to lead people to fit problems and objectives to the tools that happen to be available.  The second attitude, encouraged by an all too human desire to avoid personal responsibility for decisions is a preference for data and procedures that lend themselves to mechanization, in the belief that the elimination of human judgment is in itself desirable.  I am reminded here of what the late Norbert Wiener used to say (as far back as 1950) with regard to the use of computers.  He stressed that the greatest danger lies in our delegating to computers, out of ignorance or mental laziness, decisions that should remain ours.â€

Neither Robert Kyle nor Patrick Catling is a hopelessly bad writer, sentence by sentence, although Catling wins the nomination for the silliest line of the year (so far): â€œ Camillaâ€™s cheeks prettily pinkened. â€œ # The Deal, by G.

That is understandable, since the plot is a plain, old-fashioned story about the raunchy movie world. The hero is â€œ the Baron, â€œ Hollywoodâ€™s No. 1 superstar.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œMen may think they have more freedom and more choices, he says, but the options open to them are not meaningfully different. In this state, man rejects all thoughts that challenge societyâ€™s rationale-hence Marcuseâ€™s definition of man as â€œ one-dimensional. â€œ # â€œ The goods and services that the individuals buy, â€œ he writes, â€œ control their needs and petrify their faculties. They have dozens of newspapers and magazines that espouse the same ideals. They have innumerable <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>that keep them occupied and divert their attention from the real issue-which is the awareness that they could both work less and determine their own needs and satisfactions. â€œâ€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œDuring this time of patriotic feelings, the liberals insure the promise of pay-off from the chosen side, and they begin to send our sons, husbands, and other love ones to assist as a return on that job opportunity. / We look around at the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> we own for the first time, even if theyâ€™re not paid for, with a â€˜theyâ€™re mineâ€™ attitude, and we decide that there is no better place than America, and kiss the men good-by for God and HIS Country. / Six months later, our neighbor, our kin folk, and soon we find that our men will not return, a telegram comes telling theyâ€™re dead.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œIn addition, Consumer Reports brings you a wide range of authoritativeâ€”sometimes startlingâ€”articles.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œThis brings me to the crux of my argument. Throughout the phase of history which we have come to survey, till very recently, to be a scientist was a calling, not a job. Scientists were men of science, not just men in science. They had come to science driven by an inner urge, curiosity, a quest for knowledge, and they knew, or learned, what it was all about. They were not drawn or lured into science in masses by fascinating <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, public acclaim, manpower needs of industries and governments, or job security; nor did they just drift in for no good reason. The scene, however, is now changing rapidly. The popularity and needs of an expanding science bring in more drifters and followers than pioneers.  [â€¦]  What were their guides; Ideas, not <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, not the need to publish. Ideas, in turn, sprout from the fertile soil of experience.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œGIMMICKS HAVE seen mink headcovers, bamboo shafts, concave sand wedges, the twelve-wood, the seven-and-a-half-iron, floating balls, linoleum shoes, dome-shaped tees, distance measurers, girdles that keep your elbows together, an iron that can be converted into everything from a two-iron to a niblick, <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that steady your head, and putters as ugly as Stillson wrenches. But the silliest thing I have ever seen in golf is the headcover that goes with the ball retriever. One I saw was made of glove leather, like an Italian shoe, and. was used to protect a retriever made of anodized aluminum, a material that wouldnâ€™t rust if you left it for twenty years in the Great Salt Lake.â€

  <strong>Quote:</strong> â€œâ€ Of course you are. You know your self-hatred manifests itself in your drive to succeed in your career. And the more successful you are, the more you loathe yourself. And then you gorge â€“ secretly, in your chic, narrow esophagus of an alley kitchen with all those stainless steel <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>. â€œ Such things you gorge on, dear Monica, so tacky. Fish and chips, ice cream by the half gallon â€“ and not even ice cream from some SoHo specialty shop, but common supermarket lard. You make quite a pig of yourself, Monica, in that high-rent apartment of yours. And then you come to me. For absolution. â€œâ€
