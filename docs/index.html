If they see a thing that needs to be done, they rig up a device, mechanical or mental, and make the thing do itself with no further bother. As a result, they have created a touch-the-button civilization, and I for one admire it.  Why go on doing a thing in the same old way, over and over again, if we can make a robot do it for us, and do it better?  My hat is of to the <span class="red">gadget</span> mind." <br /><br />
