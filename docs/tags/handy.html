  <strong>Quote:</strong> “<span class="red">Gadget</span>: A gentleman who was in a department store the other day, making some modest purchases at the liquor counter, reported to us a rather surprising thing he noticed: the young lady who waited on him added up the items on the sales slip with a tiny gold adding machine which she carried inconspicuously in her hand. He fell to wondering if this was efficiency, or an effort to abash other stores, or what; finally he asked us to investigate. We did, and the explanation makes as pretty”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “a leather-covered, transistor-packed shoebox that does tricks with mirrors (honest!) to make a respectably sized picture even in seashore sunshine.  /  The Safari portable weights 15 pounds, measures about 8 1/2 by 16 1/2 by 5 1/2 inches.  The picture area is 80 square inches–same as an ordinary 14-inch screen.  It runs on batteries (which can be recharged at home) or on house current.  The price is not outrageous for such a seductive adult toy: $255” (65).  “Americans like to move around.  And they insist on taking their entertainment with them–the magazine rolled into a pocket, the portable radio held at ear level” (65-6).  “But the manufacturer’s motive for gambling a million or so on such a new product can be considerably more complex.  He may hope that (a) people will buy the <span class="red">gadget</span> because it is a Practical and Useful Convenicence; pr (b) people may not need the <span class="red">gadget</span> but will buy anyway because it is The Thing to Do, like dancing the cha-cha-cha; or © people will come into the store to see the Amazing New Invention and end up buying something else he wants to sell, as they look at convertibles and buy sedans” (65).  Other manufacturers working on their own models, including the Japanese.  * * * “Two printed-circuit boards clearly marked–like a road map–simplify trouble shooting.  They form two sides of the chassis, with the picture tube and battery filling up most of the space in between.  It makes a neat, compact and efficient assembly that pays off in convenience and performance”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “New jobs for flashlight cells include everything from polishing shoes to playing records.  Coming soon–truly portable TV sets.”  “A lot has happened since the days when flashlight batteries were used for flashlights.  Today’s big boom in battery power has been made possible by an amazing new assortment of pint-sized power plants, all of which look like flashlight batteries but do remarkably different jobs.  /  Today, you can shave by battery, listen to records by battery, mix cocktails by battery.  You can power radios, movie cameras, dictating machines, Geiger counters, fire and burglar alarms, tape recorders, clocks, kitchen food mixers–all without plugging in an electric cord.  /  In the wonderful world of the future are such bright promises as battery-run power tools, truly portable TV sets and a variety of cordless home appliances.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Apartment hunters have been known to carry portable radios with them so that they can test the noise transfer from one apartment to the next.  Some owners of cooperative apartments are compelled to spend large sums to insulate their dwellings more satisfactorily against the noise of their neighbors. […] In Europe long experience in apartment living and a popular taste for gracious living (in preference to <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>) have led to careful attention to noise control in the construction of multiple-family dwellings.  Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden and the U.S.S.R. have well-developed acoustical building codes that have been applied to the large-scale program of rebuilding of housing since World War II.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Early the next morning he bought a small TV set from a tiny Japanese man who said it was a new model and was very proud of it. Towns couldn’t get over how sharp and clear the picture was. He was not very mechanical, but he loved tiny, intricately made <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and had a vision of filling up a warm, comfortable apartment with them, living in it and spending most of his time turning them on and off. He felt a sudden burst of love for the tiny Japanese man who was practically a transistor himself and wanted to bend over and give him a hug.  The fellow was very tiny and Towns wondered what would happen if he caught a disease that made you lose weight. He would probably just get a little smaller and stay all right.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Fun and serious business with the small electronic calculator.  […]  If  you could  climb  into  a  time  machine and  go  back  to  ancient  Athens  for  a visit  with  Aristotle,  what  could  you carry in your pocket that would most aston­ish  him?  I  suggest  it  would  be  a  pocket calculator.  Its  Arabic  number  system,  its light-emitting  diodes,  its  miniaturized  cir­cuitry isomorphic with Boolean logic  (Aris­totle, remember, invented formal logic) and above all  its  computational  speed  and  power  would  intrigue  him more  than  any  other small  object  I  can  think  of.  /  The  revolutionary consequences  of  these miraculous little <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are only beginning to  be manifest. Among engineers and  scientists  the  slide  rule  has  already  become  al­most  as  obsolete  as  the  abacus. It  is  sad  to think  of  the  mathematicians  of  recent  cen­turies  who  devoted  years  to  the  arduous calculation of logarithms and trigonometric functions. Today  an  engineer  finds  it  takes less  time to  calculate  such numbers all over again  on  a  pocket  machine  than  to  look them  up  in  a  book  or  make  a  slide-rule approximation.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In fact, the West German firm of Siemens AG, using a different technology, has built a prototype 14-in. screen just 2.3 in. thick. The prototype will have a more immediate application as a computer accessory than as a home TV screen. But one slender advantage is already possible: the Siemens screen can be folded up for storage or transport. # “ Meanwhile, Sony expects the Watchman to alter, or at least extend, any number of viewing habits. People can gaze at the <span class="red">gadget</span> on the beach, carry it into stadium stands to catch instant replays, use it for soap-opera breaks while at school or work, or take it along on car trips. Predicts Warren Zorek, the manager of the consumer electronics department at Bloomingdale’s in Manhattan: A color version should be on the way before too long, and it isn’t farfetched to foresee hand-held video-game attachments and personal computer compatibility.’”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A feat of heart surgery sharpens the debate over benefits and costs # The dying heart was an I ugly yellowish color when Dr. William DeVries finally cut it loose, tore it out of the Mercurochrome-stained chest cavity, and put it to one side. For the next three hours, while a nearby heart-lung bypass machine kept the unconscious patient alive-and while a tape in the background eerily played Mendelssohn and Vivaldi-DeVries’ sure hands carefully stitched into place a grapefruit-size <span class="red">gadget</span> made of aluminum and polyurethane. At 12:50 p.m. last Monday, the Jarvik-7 artificial heart newly sewn inside William J. Schroeder began beating steadily, 70 beats to the minute. When Schroeder opened his eyes 3 hours later in the intensive-care unit, DeVries bent over his patient and whispered assurances, “ The operation is all through. You did really well. Everything is perfect. “ So, for only the second time in history, a human heart had been permanently replaced by a machine.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “As 2009 winds down and we try to come up with new and clever ways of referring to the early years of this century, there’s really only one thing left to do: declare our ten favorite <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> of the aughts and show them off in chronological order. It’s arguable that if this wasn’t the decade of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, it was certainly a decade shaped by <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> – one which saw the birth of a new kind of connectedness. In just ten years time, <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> have touched almost every aspect of our daily lives, and personal technology has come into its own in a way never before seen. It’s a decade that’s been marked the ubiquity of the internet, the downfall of the desktop, and the series finale of Friends, but we’ve boiled it down to the ten devices we’ve loved the most and worked the hardest over the past ten years. We even had some of our friends in the tech community chime in with their picks on what they thought was the <span class="red">gadget</span> or tech of the decade – so join us for a look back at the best (<span class="red">gadget</span>) years ever!”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “It seems like ages since Amazon introduced us to the $199 Fire at a hectic New York City event, but in truth that was only about six weeks ago. Maybe our perception of time is warped because we’ve been hearing talk about this 7-inch Android tablet for months now. Maybe it’s because Amazon launching a tablet seemed like such a natural thing to do after Barnes &amp; Noble paved the way with its Nook Color. Or, maybe it’s just because the <span class="red">gadget</span> Amazon shipped looks nigh-identical to the 7-inch BlackBerry PlayBook that we’ve had for, well, ages.”
