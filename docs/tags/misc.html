  <strong>Quote:</strong> “This is a political tract, set in a boiler-room (similar to those in coal-burning vessels of the time) in Hell where various souls are being punished for their sins.  “‘Harnessed up the tide–the cool, big, wet, deep, blue, sparkling sea.  I believe they did it on the pneumatic principle, not on the hydraulic, if you’re interested in those things.’  ‘I ain’t,’ Mr. Sugden retorted.  ‘I’m only concerned with outstanding social facts.  We leave machinery to the intellectuals.’  ‘That’s very kind of you.  The inventor of this particular <span class="red">gadget</span> was the son of a woman who committed suicide somewhere in the Potteries, I’m told.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “There she was.  And there he was.  In fact, putting it another way, there they both were.  And now jolly well what?  Archie rested his left ear against the forearm of a long, strongly built young man in a gray suit who had followed him into the car and was sharing his strap, and pondered.  /  Of course, in a way, the <span class="red">gadget</span> was simple.  The wheeze was, in a sense, straightforward and uncomplicated.  What he wanted to do was to point out to the injured girl all that hung on her.  He wished to touch her heart, to plead with her, to desire her to restate her war-aims, and to persuade her–before three o’clock, when that stricken gentleman would be stepping into the pitcher’s box to loose off the first ball against the Pirates–to let bygones be bygones and forgive Augustus Biddle.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Damn!’ said Freddie softly, and hurried off down the street.  He wondered whether he had made a frightful ass of himself, spraying bank-notes all over the place like that to comparative strangers.  Then a vision came to him of Nelly’s eyes as they had looked at him in the lamp-light, and he decided–no, absolutely not.  Rummy as the <span class="red">gadget</span> might appear, it had been the right thing to do.  It was a binge of which he thoroughly approved.  A good egg!”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “There are several unneccesary complications in our income tax rates, which might well be dropped out, so that the ordinary man might have a chance to udnerstand what the rates really are” (125).  “All these taxes should be as simple as possible.  <span class="red">Gadget</span>s such as the earned income credit are more nuisance than they are worth.” (146)  “We make too much of the search for small bits of justice.  Justice is a noble ideal, but far away.  When a tax bill is before hte Ways and Means Committee, one interest and another come up to plead for some minor point of justice.  One little <span class="red">gadget</span> is added to meet one objection and another little <span class="red">gadget</span> to overcome the disadvantages of the first, until the sum of a lot of little attempts to do the right is the great wrong of tying government and taxpayers in a mass of red tape”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “When the President pushes an ivory button on his desk to open the sluices of Hoover Dam or light up the symbolic Tower of Something or Other at a world’s fair, reporters, newsreel cameras and microphones are always there to trumpet abroad the drama of the occasion. When John Smith registers at a metropolitan hotel in the modern tradition, that is another simple act which sets in motion a machine as impressive as any 10,000-ton <span class="red">gadget</span> in a powerhouse. But this huge, part-human, part-mechanical organization is out of sight and silent, all the more so the better it works. If he realized the amount of smoothly oiled routine called for by the mere fact of his arrival, John Smith might get a swelled head. Which would be unfortunate, because, as the above parable indicates, this machine has a double function: It is tooled and synchronized to supply the guest whatever he wants with so much speed and so little inconvenience”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In other words, I should not be surprised if the youngest generation were taking a realistic view of politics.  They are probably looking at government simply as a <span class="red">gadget</span>, and deciding that the trouble with it is nothing but the old notorious trouble with <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>–which is that they mostly don’t work.  The scout’s young men may be taking the practical, hard-boiled view that government is a <span class="red">gadget</span> which is meant to work for the good of society while you sleep, and is not doing it.  This is a good sound view.  Looking at government as a <span class="red">gadget</span>, here are a few questions which come up.  …  First, then, since the governmental <span class="red">gadget</span> is supposed to work for the rest of society, how can it best do that?”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “This strange way of speaking can best be explained if we know what was going on in their minds during that time. Suppose, they said, that one could bombard the nuclei of atoms with charged particles. To obtain these, the experimenter would take simple atoms such as hydrogen, or helium, and knock off the outer electrons by throwing them violently around in an electrical discharge or in some other way. The <span class="red">gadget</span> in which this “knocking off” process occurred would be connected to a large, highly evacuated glass or porcelain “accelerating tube.” The particles could be led into this tube and, by the application of high voltage, could be accelerated or shot against a target covered with the atoms of the element to be investigated.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Still in their infancy–in an experimental stage according to Gallup and other poll leaders–these polls have been variously described.  The Pulse of Democracy was the title of Gallup’s book in 1940.  ‘The saviors of democracy’ was the appraisal of one University of Chicago professor; ‘a social <span class="red">gadget</span>’ was the epithet of another professor of the same university.  ‘A measure of our social illiteracy is the appropriate phrase, according to a leader in adult education.  Other descriptors include ‘seismograph of public opinion’; ‘an extra-legal anticipation of election verdicts’; periodical and persistent auditor of public opinion.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In his laboratory rink Rawson demonstrated the proper functioning of the roller skate.  The sake is attached to one of his <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> which shows the flexible action of the skate when the weight of the body is shifted to the outside and then to the inside.  You are then taken to another <span class="red">gadget</span> with a platform just big enough to accommodate one person.  Once on this <span class="red">gadget</span> there are two arms that clamp firmly about your hips so that they are held firm.  However, your limbs from the hips down are free, as is the upper part of your body.  Your hands then grasp the handles about waist high.  You are instructed to stand straight and close to the upright part of the <span class="red">gadget</span> but to avoid stiffness.  Once these instructions are carried out Rawson snaps an electric switch and you swing like the pendulum of a clock.  This <span class="red">gadget</span> conveys the action of the lean, and the beginner readily learns the feel and the meaning of the lean which he will apply later when the skates have been attached to his feet.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A small boy, I am told ran to the open door of a radio shop and asked, ‘How much is television?’ What a question indeed. How much is love, freedom, honor? How much is God? How much is community? The lad’s question was direct and simple; but as deep as depth; as long as forever; as high as the farthest unimagined star. What he means of course was how many dollars would it cost him to get one of those mysterious <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that catch pictures from the air. But television, community, life’s ultimate reallties are never purchasable in dollars and cents; yet there is real meaning in asking how much they cost.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “But neither through microscopic ob­ servation nor ingenious physical models can we achieve a feeling of intimate con­ tact with the realities of cell division. The formulation has lacked substance, which in the biology of 1953 means a treatment in terms of identifiable mole­cules undergoing reactions translatable into the language of chemistry. What is the stuff of the mitotic apparatus and how are its constituents assembled into this beautiful little <span class="red">gadget</span>? Answers to these questions solve no problems of mitosis, but put flesh between the bones of physical speculation and the clothing of microscopic appearance.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “But it may also be due to the style of the book. This  is  more  journalistic  than  literary, and sometimes the choice of words is not too  particular.  For  example,  it  quotes Samuel Butler to the effect that the “hen is  the  egg’s  device  for  laying  another egg.” Now what  Samuel  Butler  actually said,  at least in his  Life and Habit,  was something different,  namely,  that “a hen is  only  an  egg’s  way  of making  another egg.”  He  was  worrying  about  hens  not as <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, but as individuals. The lapse is  an interesting  one,  an intimation that in  the  authors’  minds  problems  of  in­dividuality belong to the  19th century of the  old-fashioned  nature  rather  than  to the 20th century of population  genetics. Yet the paradox remains that the fascina­tion of biology to the novice as well as to the  specialist depends even  now  on  the relationship  of  the  individual  to  his group,  and  not  on  considerations  of  the group alone.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “thinking he would break her frail body, but when he had finished she would come to him with great eyes wide, scrape his neck with her nails, and ask him to “ be a man again. “ One night, after finding the very middle of her in a new way, he called her later, trembling, and said, “ I shouldn’t have done that to you. Let’s not do it again. “ But they did it again the next night in his room and the fiddler opened the door, his elasticized old-man <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> dangling, and caught them at it. Stern, in an action he could not explain, carried her, without a word to the old man, out the window and to the garden below, and they never did that thing again. They parted for a year. She stayed in Oregon, and Stern, heavy with guilt as he stole a final bite, flew to New York in search of girls who knew Turgenev. A great singingfreedom came over him, but the closest he came to”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “[…] high-powered missile acquisition radar, used in tracking intercontinental ballistic missiles fired from Vandenberg, emanated lethal radiation throughout the area; needless to say, elaborate safety precautions for Navy personnel were not extended to the luckless Marshall Islanders. Today the Nike-Zeus system has been made obsolete by a more sophisticated nuclear <span class="red">gadget</span> – the Nike-X defensive missile system (ABM). Kwajalein, now the site of a $165 million Missile Site Radar system (MSR) that serves as a seeing eye for ABM’s Spartan and Sprint defense missiles, participates in more than 15,000 operations a year.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “When he woke up – or regained consciousness, that was more like it – dawn was just breaking and the hospital was as quiet as Morris supposed it ever got. He felt very calm… almost serene. He had no pain; his body felt swaddled and weightless. His bed had been surrounded by some sort of contraption like a squirrel cage – a thing of stainless steel bars, guy wires, and pulleys. His legs were being held up by cables attached to this <span class="red">gadget</span>. His back seemed to be bowed by something beneath, but it was hard to tell – he had only the angle of his vision to judge by. Others have it worse, he thought. All over the world, others have it worse. In Israel, the Palestinians kill busloads of farmers who were committing the political crime of going into town to see a movie.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “That double-agent discussion yesterday had frightened Camacho, coming as it did from a man who owned an assassin’s pistol and had enough <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> in his attic to blow up half the cops in Washington. To assess just how likely it was that good of Harlan Albright had decided to eliminate a possible threat, one would need to know just what it was that was being threatened.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Widgets and <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> (the terms are basically interchangeable) are small programs that you can add to your computer desktop, if you are running a newer version of Windows or Mac OS, or to a personalized Web portal such as iGoogle or Netvibes. These handy little applications can remind you about appointments, tell you the time or let you check your e-mail. They can also feed you the latest news headlines – the perfect way for you to stay in the loop.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The idea that Tebow would solve the Jets’ locker room issues is ridiculous. As a <span class="red">gadget</span> player? Or third string QB? Come on. Can not see how this doesn’t turn into a mess. Few bad games by Sanchez and won’t people be calling for Tebow?”  <span class="red">Gadget</span> play or <span class="red">gadget</span> player as something quirky, unusual, probably can only be used a small number of times to throw off a defense before they adapt.”
