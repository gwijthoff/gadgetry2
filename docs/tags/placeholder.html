George, how would you describe a doo-hickie?’  The officer appealed to puffed his pipe in silence for a moment [sic].  ‘Well,’ he said at length, ‘you know more or less what a <span class="red">gadget</span>’s like?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘And a gilguy?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘Well, a doo-hickie is something like that, only smaller as a rule.’ […]  The Stranger within the Gates of the Navy-that-Flies had the drink, and from then onwards forebore to ask any more questions.  But he still sometimes wonders what the functions of a doo-hickie might be.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A discussion arose at the Plymouth meeting of the Devonshire Association in 1916 when it was suggested that this word should be recorded in the list of local verbal provincialisms.  Several members dissented from its inclusion on the ground that it is in common use throughout the country and a naval officer who was present said that it has for years been a popular expression in the service for a tool or implement, the exact name of which is unknown or has for the moment been forgotten.  I have also frequently heard it applied by motor-cycle friends to the collection of fitments to be seen on motor cycles. ‘His handle-bars are smothered in <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>’ refers to such things as speedometers, mirrors, levers, badges, mascots, &amp;c., attached to the steering handles”.  /  ‘<span class="red">Gadget</span>’ is a colloquialism in the Navy for any small fitment or uncommon article–for example, ‘a curious <span class="red">gadget</span>.’  I never came across anybody who could give a derivation.” -A.G. Kealy  /  “In a list of words and phrases used by our soldiers at the Front, sent to me recently from Flanders, there is the word ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>,’ and its meaning is given as billets or quarters of any description, ‘and sometimes it is used to denote a thing of which the name is not known.’” –Archibald Sparke.  /  ‘Webster’s New International Dictionary’ says that ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ is often used of something novel, or not known by its proper name (slang).’  It is a word in frequent use in this sense by seamen and other workers.” –F.A. Russell”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “We will suppose that a factory is of just medium size and that it is governed by a General Manager and a Superintendent.  Also, that it has a Statistical Department and the usual number of factory departments with a foreman in charge of each.  The product is a small machine, which we will call a <span class="red">gadget</span>, and it is composed of a few castings, which are purchased from an outside foundry, some commerical parts, and some parts which are made in the various departments.  The factory has been turning out about thirty machines a day, but, it is desired to increase this output to forty.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A College Professor Solves a Mathematical Problem and Becomes a Wealthy Inventor.  Most of us are likely to think of an inventor as eagerly seeking some idea upon which to exercise his genius, and then bending over a work bench surrounded with wheels, wires and miscellaneous <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> trying first this combination and then that until he works out his invention.  /  He gets his patent and makes the rounds of manu­facturers, all save one of whom laugh at his radical ideas, but that one sees something in it and makes a fortune.  /  The other day we were talking with an inventor who is not like that at all. He never thought of himself as an inventor, never looked for anything to invent, never had any intention of making a lot of money, believes he is weak in imagination-that quality so often considered necessary to success­ful invention-has put in far more time writing a book than he has done in inventing, has done his in­ venting only as a sort of side line and never bothered ped­dling an invention around among manufacturers. All the inventing he does is with a pen and a note book. And yet Louis Alan Hazeltine has made a fortune out of his inventions. The best known of them, of course, is the Neu­trodyne radio receiver.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “After the long and toilsome rise, American civilization had reached, at the summer solstice of Normalcy, the high plateau of permanent peace and prosperity.  […]  Notes of jubilee drowned the plaintive cries of farmers and the queasy doubts of querulous critics.  According to the golden appearance of things, intensity would create novelty upon novelty, <span class="red">gadget</span> upon <span class="red">gadget</span>, to keep the nation’s machine whirling; inevitably outlets would be found for the accumulations of capital and the torrents of commodities; and employment would be afforded for laborers befitting their merits and diligence.  Articles for comfort and convenience, devices for diversion and amusement were multiplying with sensational rapidity, giving promise of a satisfaction even more gratifying.  Corporations were swelling in size, holding companies were rising to dizzy heights, the tide of liquid claims to wealth were flooding in.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Here again France is facing a situation which is common to all highly industrialized countries. The so-called bottlenecks of industrial production are looming large in Germany, England, even the United States, and professional economists everywhere are coming to insist that you may have large unemployment along with a serious shortage of skilled labor? indeed, paradoxically enough, the labor shortage may to a considerable extent be responsible for unemployment. The failure of one highly specialized factory manufacturing a particular <span class="red">gadget</span> may hold up a great deal of industrial production which depends directly or indirectly upon that particular <span class="red">gadget</span>. All that the November decrees did was to charge the Axe Committee with studying these bottlenecks and devising plans for a more effective distribution of labor.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “That is why the would-be mystic is always told to refrain from busying himself with matters which do not refer to his ultimate goal, or in relation to which he cannot effectively do immediate and concrete good.  This self-denying ordinance covers most of the things with which, outside business hours, the ordinary person is mainly preoccupied–news, the day’s installment of the various radio epics, this year’s car models and <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, the latest fashions.  But it is upon fashions, cars and <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, upon news and the advertising for which news exists, that our present industrial and economic system depends for its proper functioning.  For, as ex-President Hoover pointed out not long ago, this system cannot work unless the demand for non-necessaries is not merely kept up, but continually expanded.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The <span class="red">Gadget</span> Maker is a 1955 novel by Maxwell Griffith. It is notable for its vivid depiction of an otherwise-rarely-described milieu: campus life at MIT in the 1940s. It also presents a striking engineers-eye-view of guided missile development at a West Coast aerospace firm during the early days of the cold war.  On its appearance, the New York Times described The <span class="red">Gadget</span> Maker as “the story of a misguided zealot devoted body and soul to the advancement of knowledge” and called it “an absorbing narrative [and] a clear presentation of technological subject-matter, written with stylistic ease and fluidity by an author who is himself a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.”  Just a few phrases in the novel, such as “Essentially, engineering was the skilled bending and shaping of metals into airplanes, bridges, cars, <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> galore.  Still, it required more than a skill at fabrication–an understanding, some vital spark of creativeness.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Recent news reports tell us that labor unions will begin soon to press for a 30-hour week and more than likely they will win it. But not necessarily because of the aggressiveness of the unions, but rather becaue man’s skill and inventive genius have produced machines and <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that have multiplied many times the productive power of man. … For, if the modern worker, using these modern tools, spent twelve hours a day at his job, we would be faced with the problem of over-production, a situation in which there would be surplus goods, and ruinous inflation.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Like the theory of games, it is a method of pure mathematics that can be applied to human affairs.  It is used to calculate the best possible solution to a problem that involves a number of variables.  […]  To illustrate the method let us take a highly simplified hypothetical case.
