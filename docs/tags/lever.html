  <strong>Quote:</strong> “…for on taking the wheel I found a machine under my hands such as I never even heard of before.  The wheel was fixed upon the tiller in such a manner that the whole concern travelled backwards and forwards across the deck in the maddest kind of way.  […]  I fairly shook with apprehension lest the mate should come and look in the compass.  I had been accustomed to hard words if I did not steer within half a point each way;  but here was a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ that worked me to death, the result a wake like the letter S.  Gradually I got the hang of the thing, becoming easier in my mind on my own account.  Even that was not an unmixed blessing, for I had now some leisure to listen to the goings-on around the deck.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “He makes change a dozen times, answers questions with a smile, hollers ‘Step up in the aisle;’ pulls a lever here and there regulating brakes and air.  When he is prepared to go, shuts the bird-cage with his toe, moves a <span class="red">gadget</span> with his knee–regulates the speed, you see–pulls the bell cord with his teeth, lest some folks get caught beneath.  That would throw ‘er off the track; maybe flop ‘er on ‘er back.  Calls out names of every street, punches transfers with his feet.  Thus he earns his daily pay, running cars out Summit Way.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A student we interviewed said that when he applied for enrollment he did very well with the bars, and was told to go out to the line of planes waiting for flights. It was all quite casual. He was given the name of an instructor and told to report to him. He had to hunt for this man, whom he finally found off at one side of the field eating a hot dog. This teacher of fledglings, with but the preliminary of a perfunctory handshake, began his work immediate-ly by pointing out a few of the main <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>. After a little of this he told the novice to get in the plane, and off they went aloft. The student was in the air half an hour after his enrollment, not counting out the time he spent hunting up the instructor. The planes have dual controls; the student sits behind the pilot. Some instructors give advice and orders through tubes connected with earphones in the student’s helmet. Others use hand and arm signals.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “have food that the skipper will cat without a growl, or else you gain the cook’s tolerance by letting him boil rice and open a tin of beef for dinner, and hear the skipper cursing all cooks and mates to Gehenna. Besides this, you have to navigate, which breaks up your morning watches below; and you have to sailorize when you should be pacing the deck, admiring the billowy ocean, and enjoying yourself as a chief officer should!’ Feeling much better after this, I gave the flywheel another turn, flipped the spark-plug <span class="red">gadget</span> with my index finger, and to my surprise and consternation the thing started off with a terrible explosion of backfiring. With my heart in my mouth I jumped to the switch and turned it off. Then I climbed out of the engine room as nonchalantly as possible to tell, the Captain that I had just tuned up the machine and left it in fine running order. I heard you bombarding the settlement,’ Andy replied curtly, and returned to his work on the topmast gear. February 17”

They are hard to resist, those handsomely contrived, new camera models, not only because they are good to look at but the new <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are real improvements and signify advances in camera design.  Nevertheless, no matter how long or short the period during which a camera is actually in our position it was a new one when we bought it and that, for us at least, is important.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “After all,’ says the concluding sentence in the foreword to an instruction booklet for one of the Filmo cameras, ‘we made the camera, so first try our way of using it.’  There’s a lot of common sense back of that, obvious though it may appear to be.  Over-confidence and eagerness to get going with the new outfit frequently induces people of newly purchased cameras to use the camera before they have read the instructions.  The consequence too often is that something jams because some little <span class="red">gadget</span> was not properly adjusted, although reference to a single line in the instructions would have avoided the accident.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “If mitosis is not desperately discouraging as a problem of molecular biology, it is because the complex operations are embodied in a definite structural assembly––the mitotic apparatus––that can be regarded as a <span class="red">gadget</span> for performing the operations.  We can approach the physics and chemistry of mitosis through the study of the formation, structure and changes of the mitotic apparatus, without forgetting that mitosis is an operation of the whole cell.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “During my latest visit to Madison, I found Connie busily taking notes in a room containing two cages not side by side, but connected here and there with wires and tubes. Each held a baby monkey and a number of tiny, mysterious <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>: handles, buttons, and boxes of differing dimensions. “ I’m testing their learning ability and reactions, “ she explained. “ This one on my right can turn on a picture show whenever he likes? colored slides, you know, one after another, on that little screen thing. When he gets tired of watching those, he can get himself a drink of water by pulling the string here. He can make this toy slide up and down, and open that inner door or […]”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “[…]others stood around carrying the beers, the whiskey, the whatnot like altarbearers but with considerably more guilt and with a stirring in their gut that you feel in a whorehouse when you’re told to wait for the girl and suddenly you hear high-heel steps coming down the hall and envision the legs, the garters, the thighs, the panties, the breasts, the throat, the face, the hair of the woman coming – This was exactly the way they felt when Johnson unhooked the storm door with that delicacy of thumb and forefinger you need for such <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and as though he was unfastening a brassiere from the bulge-back of the house. Wild children opened the door; there was a lot of stumbling over things on the porch floor but Cody never dreamed that one of the crazy little giggling girls who had been sent by the gals to open up while they brush up the last wave was Joanna Dawson his future wife. In America it’s always two girls and one is always older and uglier than the other, except in this case it was more accurate[…]”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Absentmindedly he pressed a button on the desktop. The tambour or of a faux-Sheraton cabinet rolled back, revealing the screen of a television set. Another of his dear weeping decorator’s touches. He opened the desk drawer and took out the remote-control <span class="red">gadget</span> and ticked the set to life. The news. The Mayor of New York. A stage. Angry crowd of black people. Harlem. A lot of thrashing about. A riot. The Mayor takes cover. Shouts… chaos… a real rhubarb. Absolutely pointless. To Sherman it had no more meaning than a gust of wind. He couldn’t concentrate on it. He clicked it off.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Rubber padding held on with rubber bands covered the camera body. A wire led to it. He stood on the stairs and examined it with his flashlight, then reached up and removed the camera, excess wire following along. The wire was connected to a <span class="red">gadget</span> on top with a small alligator clip. With the stairwell light off, he unclipped it and carried the camera to the kitchen table. Unwrapping the rubber padding with gloves on was difficult, so he took them off. The <span class="red">gadget</span> on top was some kind of an electromagnetic doohickey with a lever. When the current was turned on by flippingthe light switch, the magnet was energized and caused this steel pin to push the camera shutter button, tripping the shutter. When the current ceased, a spring reset the lever, which released the shutter button and allowed the film to be automatically advancedby the camera.”
