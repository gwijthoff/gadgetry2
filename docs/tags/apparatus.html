  <strong>Quote:</strong> “There were several earlier types which, although they had their defects, were very effective and frequently ‘spotted’ the Kaiser’s subs at distances of several miles and aided our sub-chasers in running them down and giving them the spurlos versenkt with one of our neat little ash cans.  The more modern apparatus upon which I personally worked was not perfected in time to have actual service overseas.  This remarkable ‘gadget,’ which is known as the multi-unit or M.V. Type of hydrophone, consists in general of two lines of twelve equally spaced microphones.  They are mounted – one on each side – below the water line and either beneath a protective ‘blister’ outside the skin of the vessel or sometimes within the forward water tank.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Only about a decade ago, we had an infant industry, manufacturing radio sets, which was facing a problem unprecedented in business history.  For in order to sell its product and thrive, it had to produce something else which that product could pluck out of the air.  This was the beginning of broadcasting.  /  A gadget which boys of all ages had put together in the attic, came down into the living-room.  Promptly technical discoveries began revolutionizing the gadget itself; and a growing and vociferous demand for good programs created a second bewildering problem.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Yet in all our wide reading about the unfortunate incident, we recall not one hint of certain broader implications. Too much was said of war psychosis and nothing of the normal human equation. We had thought that the Brooklyn Bridge would find no “buyers” now, yet the confidence men who periodically “sold” that structure in the old days had a harder job than the broadcasters of H. G Wells’ drama, for the latter explained over and over what they were doing. It begins to look as though there must be something inherent in the radio, in the mystery of a voice coming from an unseen speaker through a gadget of wires and tubes, that inspires unquestioning confidence. Otherwise, despite the war psychosis explanation, why did not more people question this particular broadcast as did one man we know who did not hear the original announcement?”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The effects of war on science itself were also both good and bad.  Unfortunately, the spectacular achievements of the war years led many people to believe that the sole function of science was to develop either weapons of war or the gadgets of peace.  Radar, rockets, and the atomic bomb, together with plastic automobiles, nuclear power plants, and television sets were regarded as the sole products of science, the reason for its existence, or the chief currency with which to measure its value.”  Example:  “A steel mill is built to make steel.  As the bars of steel come out of the mill the ear not labeled as to whether they shall be used for battleships or tanks or trucks or guns or plows.  Steel is a raw material.  It will be fabricated into whatever structures, gadgets, devices, or weapons are most in demand at the moment.”  “Too often we judge the value of knowledge by the new machines or gadgets or weapons it provides.  But a more far-reaching effect of knowledge is its effects on men’s minds.” “

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Late in the 18th century Charles Stanhope, third Earl, a British statesman and inventor, built the first true logic machine, the Stanhope Demonstrator.  The Demonstrator was a crude gadget for solving syllogisms.  A syllogism consists of a major premise and a minor premise, the first making a statement about a “predicate term” and a “middle term,” the second about the same middle term and a “subject term.” By eliminating the middle term one arrives at the correct conclusion as to the relation of subject to predicate. In Stanhope’s Demonstrator the middle term was represented by a small wooden panel called the “holon.” It had a frame through which other panels could be slid to cover all or part of the holon. A panel of gray wood, representing the subject, was pushed in from the left, and one of red glass, representing the predicate, was pushed in over this from the right.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The early extracurricular interests of these men were varied, but here, too, there are some general patterns. More of the physicists than of the other groups showed early interests directly related to their later occupations, but this seems quite clearly to be due to the common small-boy preoccupation in this country with physical gadgets–radio, Meccano sets and so on. The theoretical physicists were omnivorous readers, the experimentalists much less so.  […]  From fiddling with gadgets to becoming a physicist may be no great leap, but the attractions of theoretical physics are not so obvious or well known, nor are those of the social sciences or advanced biology.”

The Atomic Energy Commission has just issued a new policy directive on the use of the lie detector at Oak Ridge.  It will no longer be used for periodic mass examinations of the several thousand employees assigned there to ‘sensitive’ jobs.  Future lie detector examinations anywhere in the AEC will be confined to specific cases and will be undertaken on a ‘voluntary’ basis and only when authorized by the general manager.”  “

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Claude E. Shannon, Hagelbarger’s colleague at Bell Labs, built a second penny matcher along the same lines, but using a different criterion for deciding when the opponent’s play pattern justifies a departure from random choices.  In an article in the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, Shannon describes how the designers tried to figure out mathematically which machine could beat the other.  They finally had to give up and leave the experiment.  They built a third machine to act as umpire and go-between, plugged all three together and let them run, ‘to the accompaniment of small side bets and loud cheering.’  Although he does not specify the owner of the winning gadget, Shannon reports that the ‘more precipitate of the who consistently beat the larger, more deliberate one in a ratio of about 55 to 45.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The men have been crowded nearly off the ship by electronic gadgets.  Radar sets and automatic control devices take up so much room that the crew must sling its hammocks in odd corners and queue up for an hour to get a meal.  Water is rationed because machines have replaced some of the storage tanks.  So the sailors begin to extract a vacuum tube here, drop a quiet monkey wrench there.  The press, as over-hasty in taking reassurance as it had been in taking alarm, was naively relieved to learn that the trouble was not foreign sabotage but just a revolt of the crew.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Among other discoveries, it was found possible  to  make  the  brain  stimulate  itself  by  positive  feedback.  The  electric impulses from the brain were  connected through  the  recording  machine  to  the electronic  gadget  that  produced  the flashes  of  light.  In  this  way  a  brain  re­sponse  to  a  flash  triggered  a  new  flash and  so  on.  This  method  of  self-excite­ment  is  particularly  effective  for  reveal­ing  a  hidden  tendency  to  epileptic seizures.  It  resembles  very  closely  the way an engineer may test the stability of a  transmission  system:  he  applies  posi­tive  feedback  to disturb  the  system  and observes how effectively the system’s in­herent  negative  feedback  operates  to damp  the  disturbance  and  restore  equi­librium.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “One night, about two in the morning, the door of our shack was thrown open with a bang and, before I knew what was happening, I felt a hand gripping my throat, squeezing it viciously.  I knew damned well I wasn’t dreaming.  Then a voice, a boozy voice which I recognized instantly, and which sounded maudlin and terrifying, shouted in my ear: ‘Where’s that damned gadget?’  /  ‘What gadget?’  I gurgled, struggling to release the grip around my throat.  /  ‘The radio!  Where are you hiding it?”

It  remains  to  be  seen  whether these  methods  will  prove  feasible  for spectroscopy  or  for  gadgets  such  as radar.  Whenever  a  practical  method  is developed  for  generating  high-power radio  waves  in  the  region  between  one­ half  millimeter  and  five  millimeters-a source  which  is  tunable  and  produces highly  monochromatic  waves-it  will  be of great value to science and  to  industry.”

Some sputtering pictures showed up. “ See that, “ said the porter, “ she coming in good. “ It came as no great surprise to Towns when the pictures bleeped out and turned to darkness. There was a package of warranties in the box, but Towns had no heart to get started with them. Besides, he had the feeling that once a mechanical gadget was injured, it went downhill no matter what you did to it. He gave the porter a look and then tossed the set lightly into a trash container. Someone in the terminal said the astronauts were going to be down in forty-five minutes. There wasn’t any time to fool around now.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Lately there is a new symbol of status. Free of charge, Washington’s C &amp;; P Telephone Co. has installed ten of its still experimental “ picturephones “ in the offices of the highest presidential advisers. The gadgets, small TV sets attached to the telephone, allow the presidential elite to dial-in one another’s images as well as voices-not that any one of them is likely to forget what the others look like.  Apart from broadcasting status, the picturephones contribute little to the smoother workings of Government. To Egghead Kissinger, they are a technological mystery. He will not call on the device, but does take calls, with a bit of fuming and fussing as he tries to work the thing.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In adult life, in depressive and schizophrenic states, suicides and macabre mutilations are performed in the kitchen; and death by gas oven asphyxiation is a common type of suicide. Cases are reported where the individuals put their heads into the oven. The obsessive-compulsive neurotic fears sharp instruments and constantly worries about the gas heater being turned off or the toaster being disconnected. In the hysterical individual, the appliances often symbolize objects of both an oral and genital nature, wherever there can be substitute gratification and punishment. The hysterical patient may be fascinated with gadgetry and at the same time be worried about the safety of such automatic controls as timers, defrosters, and thermostats, as are built into the appliances. All modes of energy are transformed, neutralized, and regulated in the service of making life easier and supposedly more pleasureful. Very often the hope is that new devices will be both labor-saving and in the long run “ pay for themselves. “ Abetting the economic factor is the condensation of many processes and functions in the same unit.”

Lesser, for a surprised second, couldn’t imagine why he had come, was startled by the sight of him.  Willie wore a blue-and-purple sack-like woolen African tunic over his overalls. His hair wasn’t Afro-styled, as Lesser had thought, but combed straight as though against the grain, with a part on the left side, and raised in back like a floor plank that had sprung up. The stringy goatee flowering under his chin lengthened his face and seemed to emphasize the protrusive quality of his eyes, more white than brown. Standing, he was about five ten, taller than Lesser had imagined. “ Could I park this gadget here till the morning? I would hate to have it stolen out of my office. I been hiding it in the closet but that ain’t hiding, if you dig. “ Lesser, after hesitation, dug. “ Are you through for the day? “ “ What’s it to you? “ “ Nothing, I only thought? “ “ I go on from eight to twelve or thereabouts, “ said the black, “ full four hours’ work and then goof off?”

But I want you to hear. Can you do that? “ “ You’re coming in weak. “ “ How about now? “ “ Better. “ “ I’m down on the floor shouting up into the talk gadget. Don’t try to see me. Do you know where I am? “ “ Down on the floor. “ “ I mean where in what locale. “ “ The hobby room. “ “ Good guess. “ “ I recognized the tricycle. “ “ That’s where I am, all right. Walked in early this morning. Came in from the hole. Came limping through the mud and grass. I’ve been digging, lad. Clawing my way down.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Serena phoned. She was flying into Los Angeles and was free to spend the night with him, she said. He immediately canceled his other plans and agreed to collect her in three hours at the airport. Almost automatically, he asked where she was. “ There is no message, “ she whispered. Levanter took a taxi to the airport. He was half an hour early and dismissed the cab. He wandered through the lounges, watched the departing passengers lined up to pass through the gates of the electronic surveillance gadgetry, had a cup of coffee, and finally went to stand at the entrance of the terminal, where he was to meet her.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A radio receiver, in addition to being a musical instrument, is also unfortunately a piece of furniture and a complex scientific gadget. As a musical instrument it finds its response limited at high frequencies by station-crowding in the wavelength bands, which at present sets a legal upper limit of 5000 cycles, while furniture fashion cuts off the low frequencies by preventing the use of a suitable loud-speaker.”

The heart and lungs were sound, but other internal organs yellow with rot. # The death of Mrs. Cardow, onetime dial painter for the Waterbury Clock Co., like the deaths and protracted illnesses of U.S. Radium Corp. scientists and minor employes (TIME, June 4, Nov. 26) is a social penalty for the public’s demand to have night-luminous watches, clocks, gadgets.”

Also, the same system permits him to listen in on the monitor wire and hear what the engineers in the control rooms are saying to each other.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The tapes that prompted Richard Nixon’s Watergate resignation in 1974 might never have existed had he not been such a klutz with gadgets. Nixon was reluctant to have his conversations recorded, writes former Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman in Prologue, a National Archives publication. But if there had to be a taping system, the President said, he wanted something simple – like Lyndon Johnson’s manually operated setup. # Haldeman was worried that his chief would forget to turn the gizmo on when he wanted it, or – worse – to turn it off when he didn’t. Haldeman also fretted “ that this President was far too inept”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The list of “ indirect “ spinoffs from Project Apollo features one of the most revolutionary gadgets of modern times: the home computer. Back in the late 1950s, the state-of-the-art computer was the size of a city block. The space program encouraged an extraordinary process of miniaturization that down-sized master computers. As it happened, the Eagle’s 17-pound model was not equal to its task. But its development helped spark the personal-computer revolution.”

It’ s Spectrum AC (for alternating current), a new type of modem that allows data to be transmitted at high speed over the standard electrical wiring in homes. Computers and accessories wouldn’ t need to have special cables connecting them, making it easier to move them between rooms without clumsy rewiring. NEC Corp. of Japan says the product will be available in the U.S. later this year, probably retailing below $300. Since at least two modems are needed. . .”

MCA brings Universal Studios, movie theaters, theme parks, MCA records and publishing to the altar; Matsushita mass-produces every conceivable electronic gadget, from Panasonic and Technics stereos to rice cookers and computers. The deal is the largest Japanese acquisition of an American company ever, and raises some of the same thorny foreign-ownership questions that surrounded Sony’s nearly $5 billion purchase of Columbia Pictures in 1989.”

By return mail, he received a letter of dissuasion and supplication from the company. Many people (the letter reasonably pointed out I will be confused and annoyed by having a machine answer their call, and still hang up without leaving any message at all. Patients look for personal interest in their calls, and the cold and mechanical approach of a machine destroys personal confidence.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Programmed with the salaries of the participants, the device starts with the push of a button and, on a wall-mounted Scoreboard, flashes a minute-by-minute reckoning of the conference cost. The more and the mightier the brass, Lyngso explains, “ the more power is used, the faster the wheels run and the larger the bill becomes. “ # A tinkerer who started out in a small basement shop 16 years ago, Lyngso credits the gadget with cutting down the proliferation of meetings that have come with the growth of his own firm, Soren T. Lyngso, Dansk Servo Teknik, to two plants and 160 employees. He finds that the machine starts saving money even before conferences start: nowadays his managers whenever possible skip calling meetings rather than watch the machine add up the cost.”
