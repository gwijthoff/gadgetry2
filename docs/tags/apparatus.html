  <strong>Quote:</strong> “There were several earlier types which, although they had their defects, were very effective and frequently ‘spotted’ the Kaiser’s subs at distances of several miles and aided our sub-chasers in running them down and giving them the spurlos versenkt with one of our neat little ash cans.  The more modern apparatus upon which I personally worked was not perfected in time to have actual service overseas.  This remarkable ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>,’ which is known as the multi-unit or M.V. Type of hydrophone, consists in general of two lines of twelve equally spaced microphones.  They are mounted – one on each side – below the water line and either beneath a protective ‘blister’ outside the skin of the vessel or sometimes within the forward water tank.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Only about a decade ago, we had an infant industry, manufacturing radio sets, which was facing a problem unprecedented in business history.  For in order to sell its product and thrive, it had to produce something else which that product could pluck out of the air.  This was the beginning of broadcasting.  /  A <span class="red">gadget</span> which boys of all ages had put together in the attic, came down into the living-room.  Promptly technical discoveries began revolutionizing the <span class="red">gadget</span> itself; and a growing and vociferous demand for good programs created a second bewildering problem.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Yet in all our wide reading about the unfortunate incident, we recall not one hint of certain broader implications. Too much was said of war psychosis and nothing of the normal human equation. We had thought that the Brooklyn Bridge would find no “buyers” now, yet the confidence men who periodically “sold” that structure in the old days had a harder job than the broadcasters of H. G Wells’ drama, for the latter explained over and over what they were doing. It begins to look as though there must be something inherent in the radio, in the mystery of a voice coming from an unseen speaker through a <span class="red">gadget</span> of wires and tubes, that inspires unquestioning confidence. Otherwise, despite the war psychosis explanation, why did not more people question this particular broadcast as did one man we know who did not hear the original announcement?”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A radio receiver, in addition to being a musical instrument, is also unfortunately a piece of furniture and a complex scientific <span class="red">gadget</span>. As a musical instrument it finds its response limited at high frequencies by station-crowding in the wavelength bands, which at present sets a legal upper limit of 5000 cycles, while furniture fashion cuts off the low frequencies by preventing the use of a suitable loud-speaker.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The effects of war on science itself were also both good and bad.  Unfortunately, the spectacular achievements of the war years led many people to believe that the sole function of science was to develop either weapons of war or the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> of peace.  Radar, rockets, and the atomic bomb, together with plastic automobiles, nuclear power plants, and television sets were regarded as the sole products of science, the reason for its existence, or the chief currency with which to measure its value.”  Example:  “A steel mill is built to make steel.  As the bars of steel come out of the mill the ear not labeled as to whether they shall be used for battleships or tanks or trucks or guns or plows.  Steel is a raw material.  It will be fabricated into whatever structures, <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, devices, or weapons are most in demand at the moment.”  “Too often we judge the value of knowledge by the new machines or <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> or weapons it provides.  But a more far-reaching effect of knowledge is its effects on men’s minds.” “

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Late in the 18th century Charles Stanhope, third Earl, a British statesman and inventor, built the first true logic machine, the Stanhope Demonstrator.  The Demonstrator was a crude <span class="red">gadget</span> for solving syllogisms.  A syllogism consists of a major premise and a minor premise, the first making a statement about a “predicate term” and a “middle term,” the second about the same middle term and a “subject term.” By eliminating the middle term one arrives at the correct conclusion as to the relation of subject to predicate. In Stanhope’s Demonstrator the middle term was represented by a small wooden panel called the “holon.” It had a frame through which other panels could be slid to cover all or part of the holon. A panel of gray wood, representing the subject, was pushed in from the left, and one of red glass, representing the predicate, was pushed in over this from the right.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The early extracurricular interests of these men were varied, but here, too, there are some general patterns. More of the physicists than of the other groups showed early interests directly related to their later occupations, but this seems quite clearly to be due to the common small-boy preoccupation in this country with physical <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>–radio, Meccano sets and so on. The theoretical physicists were omnivorous readers, the experimentalists much less so.  […]  From fiddling with <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> to becoming a physicist may be no great leap, but the attractions of theoretical physics are not so obvious or well known, nor are those of the social sciences or advanced biology.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Claude E. Shannon, Hagelbarger’s colleague at Bell Labs, built a second penny matcher along the same lines, but using a different criterion for deciding when the opponent’s play pattern justifies a departure from random choices.  In an article in the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers, Shannon describes how the designers tried to figure out mathematically which machine could beat the other.  They finally had to give up and leave the experiment.  They built a third machine to act as umpire and go-between, plugged all three together and let them run, ‘to the accompaniment of small side bets and loud cheering.’  Although he does not specify the owner of the winning <span class="red">gadget</span>, Shannon reports that the ‘more precipitate of the who consistently beat the larger, more deliberate one in a ratio of about 55 to 45.”

Radar sets and automatic control devices take up so much room that the crew must sling its hammocks in odd corners and queue up for an hour to get a meal.  Water is rationed because machines have replaced some of the storage tanks.  So the sailors begin to extract a vacuum tube here, drop a quiet monkey wrench there.  The press, as over-hasty in taking reassurance as it had been in taking alarm, was naively relieved to learn that the trouble was not foreign sabotage but just a revolt of the crew.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Among other discoveries, it was found possible  to  make  the  brain  stimulate  itself  by  positive  feedback.  The  electric impulses from the brain were  connected through  the  recording  machine  to  the electronic  <span class="red">gadget</span>  that  produced  the flashes  of  light.  In  this  way  a  brain  re­sponse  to  a  flash  triggered  a  new  flash and  so  on.  This  method  of  self-excite­ment  is  particularly  effective  for  reveal­ing  a  hidden  tendency  to  epileptic seizures.  It  resembles  very  closely  the way an engineer may test the stability of a  transmission  system:  he  applies  posi­tive  feedback  to disturb  the  system  and observes how effectively the system’s in­herent  negative  feedback  operates  to damp  the  disturbance  and  restore  equi­librium.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “It is safe to say that few of us Americans fully realize the progress this country has made in a handful of years. The editor of the Port Gibson, Mississippi, Reveille touches on this in relating how that town has improved its community life. In 1928, he said, “Port Gibson was struggling along with flickering lights, and a few small motors, which seemed they might burn out any minute, until the town finally voted to sell its worn out municipal plant to the Mississippi Power &amp; Light Company. “Had there been television in 1928,” he said, “we think it would have been useless in Port Gibson, to say nothing of home freezers, electric refrigerators, washers, dryers, garbage disposals, industrial motors, air conditioning, and a host of other <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> run by that wonderful force which no one can adequately define, but everyone calls electric power.””

These are my fellow humans, yearning for health, education, a place in the sun for | their children, the entrancing <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> of the modern world, respect, peace, and? “ Free-DOM! “”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Sterling will furnish its Teleguide service free of charge, and will support the venture by selling one-minute advertising spots, live nr on film, which will he limited to two and a half minutes out of every fifteen minutes of programming. Unlike the tourists who will absorb enlightenment from Teleguide, brokers hoping to benefit from the services rendered by Telequote II, a prodigious <span class="red">gadget</span>, already in operation, that compresses all market information into a single system and flashes stock quotations in Kelly green, have to pay a rental fee of seven hundred and fifty dollars … Four of Telequotes eight channels feature current last-sales prices of issues traded on the N. Y. and the American Stock Exchanges. Telequote II was developed by the Teleregister Corporation, of Stamford. (Telequote I performed the same function, in a less elaborate way outside of N.Y.), it was also developed by the Teleregister Corporation.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “For years, our friend had subscribed to a telephone-answering service, but recently, in an access of modernity, he decided to employ a recording <span class="red">gadget</span> instead, and so informed the answering service. By return mail, he received a letter of dissuasion and supplication from the company. Many people (the letter reasonably pointed out I will be confused and annoyed by having a machine answer their call, and still hang up without leaving any message at all. Patients look for personal interest in their calls, and the cold and mechanical approach of a machine destroys personal confidence.”

The more and the mightier the brass, Lyngso explains, “ the more power is used, the faster the wheels run and the larger the bill becomes. “ # A tinkerer who started out in a small basement shop 16 years ago, Lyngso credits the <span class="red">gadget</span> with cutting down the proliferation of meetings that have come with the growth of his own firm, Soren T. Lyngso, Dansk Servo Teknik, to two plants and 160 employees. He finds that the machine starts saving money even before conferences start: nowadays his managers whenever possible skip calling meetings rather than watch the machine add up the cost.”

Some sputtering pictures showed up. “ See that, “ said the porter, “ she coming in good. “ It came as no great surprise to Towns when the pictures bleeped out and turned to darkness. There was a package of warranties in the box, but Towns had no heart to get started with them. Besides, he had the feeling that once a mechanical <span class="red">gadget</span> was injured, it went downhill no matter what you did to it. He gave the porter a look and then tossed the set lightly into a trash container. Someone in the terminal said the astronauts were going to be down in forty-five minutes.

Free of charge, Washington’s C &amp;; P Telephone Co. has installed ten of its still experimental “ picturephones “ in the offices of the highest presidential advisers. The <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, small TV sets attached to the telephone, allow the presidential elite to dial-in one another’s images as well as voices-not that any one of them is likely to forget what the others look like.  Apart from broadcasting status, the picturephones contribute little to the smoother workings of Government. To Egghead Kissinger, they are a technological mystery. He will not call on the device, but does take calls, with a bit of fuming and fussing as he tries to work the thing.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In adult life, in depressive and schizophrenic states, suicides and macabre mutilations are performed in the kitchen; and death by gas oven asphyxiation is a common type of suicide. Cases are reported where the individuals put their heads into the oven. The obsessive-compulsive neurotic fears sharp instruments and constantly worries about the gas heater being turned off or the toaster being disconnected. In the hysterical individual, the appliances often symbolize objects of both an oral and genital nature, wherever there can be substitute gratification and punishment. The hysterical patient may be fascinated with <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> and at the same time be worried about the safety of such automatic controls as timers, defrosters, and thermostats, as are built into the appliances. All modes of energy are transformed, neutralized, and regulated in the service of making life easier and supposedly more pleasureful. Very often the hope is that new devices will be both labor-saving and in the long run “ pay for themselves. “ Abetting the economic factor is the condensation of many processes and functions in the same unit.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Shortly after noon––after a nearby siren yelped for a few seconds to remind one, if he had forgotten, of the perilous state of the world––Willie kicked on Lesser’s door with the heel of his shoe, holding in both arms, in fact weighed down by it, his massive typewriter.  Lesser, for a surprised second, couldn’t imagine why he had come, was startled by the sight of him.  Willie wore a blue-and-purple sack-like woolen African tunic over his overalls. His hair wasn’t Afro-styled, as Lesser had thought, but combed straight as though against the grain, with a part on the left side, and raised in back like a floor plank that had sprung up. The stringy goatee flowering under his chin lengthened his face and seemed to emphasize the protrusive quality of his eyes, more white than brown. Standing, he was about five ten, taller than Lesser had imagined. “ Could I park this <span class="red">gadget</span> here till the morning? I would hate to have it stolen out of my office. I been hiding it in the closet but that ain’t hiding, if you dig. “ Lesser, after hesitation, dug. “ Are you through for the day? “ “ What’s it to you? “ “ Nothing, I only thought? “ “ I go on from eight to twelve or thereabouts, “ said the black, “ full four hours’ work and then goof off?”
