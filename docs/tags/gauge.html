  <strong>Quote:</strong> ““Having personally searched through the British patents before taking out my own, I can well understand your objection to ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ stabilisers. Only one or two, if any, of the inventions ot be found there bear the stamp of the practical man, few appear to be products of men who had had any experience of aeroplanes, mostly the inventor seems to have had a ‘nebulous fancy which passed with him for thought.’ None the less, when one considers how cheaply such an apparatus as I have suggested could be put to the test, it seems a pity that we should not learn whatever it has to teach us, always bearing in mind that experimental mechanism must be capable of instant disconnection at the pilot’s discretion.” / A well known aviator writes:–“I must give vent to my feelings about ‘<span class="red">gadget</span> stabilisers.’ First of all I must admit ot being prejudiced against any such thing. Not only would any such device give me ‘cold feet,’ but probably cold hands as well, having nothing to do with them, in the shape of stick wagging, etc., but seriously there is one point which I do not think anybody has yet brought up, and that is this: With the arrival of the fool-proof aeroplane, which the birth of ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ devices seems to herald, there will have also to arise, and probably will, a fool (not proof) market to buy them. This, as it should be, is good for trade, but m yfear is that with the arrival of this class of buyer there is a grave danger of there arising a host of incompetent builders, who each and all will strive to turn out a cheap machine, and in this ambition they will be most undesirably assisted by the ‘<span class="red">gadget</span> stabiliser,’ for instead of spending money on designing a machine properly, any old thing with wings will do, if fitted with some patent <span class="red">gadget</span> which will do it for them. But what about it, if this <span class="red">gadget</span> jams or dislocates itself, as all such things must do some time or other?””

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Of the making of motor accessories anything that can be screwed or stuck on to any part of a car under the claim of increasing the efficiency of that part—like the making of books, there is no end. Most of them outweigh by their certain cost and manifest complication, any advantage their use could obtain. I make however, an exception of the tell-tale type of <span class="red">gadget</span>, as prevention of trouble is better than the cure which at the same time may kill. One of these is an overheating tell-tale in the form of a plug set into the water circulation, electrically connected with a tiny red lamp on the dash board—which I saw at a depot for American accessories in Shaftesbury Avenue W.C.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “There are rival methods of achieving this end, some constructors (among them Orville Wright in America) seeking to attain it by ‘automatic’ and others by ‘inherent’ stability.  The latter speak disrespectfully of the devices of the former; they call them ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ stabilizers.  The word is a trifle obscure, inasmuch as ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ is the sea term for any miscellaneous article which does not appear to have a definite name, or at least one which comes ready at the moment.  I asked a famous expert the other day to define a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span> stabilizer,’ and he did s promptly and forcibly as ‘any old thing which you hang on.’  Less picturesquely an automatic stabilizer is some means of giving stability, such as a gyroscope or a pendulum, which is put to a machine, and is not in itself an essential part of its construction.  /  The inherent stability people maintain that by careful design and constructino alone, by theorist and practical man working side by side, by scientific disposal of weights and surfaces, different tendencies may be made to balance and correct each other, one set of oscilations to damp out another, and so the perfect machine be evolved.  Further they have proved their point by succeeding.  The naturally stable machine is no dream of to-morrow but the realization of to-day; not sprung upon us in a moment by some fresh epoch-making discovery, but now arrived at as the consummation of the labours which began with the earliest pioneers.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Every other officer has a pet mechanical originality.  Marmaduke is preparing a small gravity tank for his machine, to be used when the pressure tank is ventilated by a bullet.  The Tripehound has a scheme whereby all the control wires can be duplicated.  Some one else has produced the latest thing in connections between the pilot’s joystick and the Vicker’s gun.  I am making a spade-grip trigger for the Lewis gun, so that the observer can always have one hand free to manipulate the movable backsight.  When one of these deathless inventions is completed the real hard work begins.  The <span class="red">gadget</span> is adopted unanimously by the inventor himself, but he has a tremendous task in making the rest of the squadron see its merits.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A patent <span class="red">gadget</span> invented by Guns [the gunnery officer] allowed the gun-muzzles a certain amount of play up and down, play which careful calculation showed would pour a couple of streams of bullets across the end of the wood up and down a height extending to about a thousand feet, that is, 500 above and 500 below the level at which it was estimated the Huns usually flew on these night raids.  It simply meant that as soon as the sound was judged to be near enough the two guns only had to open fire, to keep pouring out bullets to make sure that the Huns had to fly through the stream and ‘stop one’ or more.  It was, in fact, a simple air barrage of machine-gun bullets.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “On a dashboard in front of the pilot are various engine controls, comprising an independent throttle lever for each engine, a revolution counter, spark controls for both magnetos, a grease pump, gasoline regulator, and various other ‘<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.’  The flying controls do not differ in any particular way from those of the ordinary machine, the Deperdussin wheel type being adopted.  Naturally, they are much more powerful, and by an ingenious system of springs worked round a small hand-winch close to the pilot’s seat, the elevator can be locked in any position desired.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A discussion arose at the Plymouth meeting of the Devonshire Association in 1916 when it was suggested that this word should be recorded in the list of local verbal provincialisms.  Several members dissented from its inclusion on the ground that it is in common use throughout the country and a naval officer who was present said that it has for years been a popular expression in the service for a tool or implement, the exact name of which is unknown or has for the moment been forgotten.  I have also frequently heard it applied by motor-cycle friends to the collection of fitments to be seen on motor cycles. ‘His handle-bars are smothered in <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>’ refers to such things as speedometers, mirrors, levers, badges, mascots, &amp;c., attached to the steering handles”.  /  ‘<span class="red">Gadget</span>’ is a colloquialism in the Navy for any small fitment or uncommon article–for example, ‘a curious <span class="red">gadget</span>.’  I never came across anybody who could give a derivation.” -A.G. Kealy  /  “In a list of words and phrases used by our soldiers at the Front, sent to me recently from Flanders, there is the word ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>,’ and its meaning is given as billets or quarters of any description, ‘and sometimes it is used to denote a thing of which the name is not known.’” –Archibald Sparke.  /  ‘Webster’s New International Dictionary’ says that ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ is often used of something novel, or not known by its proper name (slang).’  It is a word in frequent use in this sense by seamen and other workers.” –F.A.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “But the Rolls-Royce Company would never pay big dividends upon the patronage or custom of the minority who buy their cars as toys–to play with all the intriguing little <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> with which they are fitted.”  (124)  /  “The motor car trade is a ‘fashion’ trade, just as much as ladies’ hats, and if there is a desire for taper bonnets or pointed radiators, or any of the many <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> we have to fit, it is necessary to conform to that desire, or else the car is difficult to sell.” (140)  /   IN THE RETORT/CONVERSATION:  “The author cannot seriously suggest that the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> designed into the majority of cars, especially the high-priced types, are undesirable fads.  That would be an insult to the intelligence of their sponsors, who are presumably men who know their jobs both on the technical and financial side.  Any <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> embodied in a design are, rightly or wrongly, provided for a specific purpose and achieve some refinement which a competitor’s car does not possess.  I say rightly or wrongly, as they do not always fulfil [sic] expectation.” (143)  /  “I really cannot help wondering whether all the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> on those big, magnificent cars we aw at Olympia are really necessary, when I can get equal or greater comfort, smoothness and quietness without them.  IT is very nice, of course, to be able to sit back in a chair and adjust the petrol-feed of the carburettor to such a degree that the mixture can be gradually varied while under way.  It is beautiful for the man who wants to do it, but the very man who buys a GBP 2,000 car does not do it.”  (148)  /   “The man who can afford GBP2,000 for a chassis , who can afford all the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> in the world, and who sits in the car while his man does the rest, does not care how many <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> the car is fitted with, so long as he gets from his house to his office in time.”  (157)  /  “As a designer I object to exaggerated smoothness of design, and though at a Motor Show clean outline may look charming, I feel that external smoothness can be overdone.  The question of suiting the springing of a car to the load in the car has always been rather a fancy of mine, and although it is an extra <span class="red">gadget</span> I think it will shortly be fitted on a number of cars.  I do not say it is a good thing on every car, but there are plenty of people who will appreciate a device which will ensure equally good suspension, whether the car is light or loaded.  […]  As far as other <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> go, such as controllable carburettors, I must say I do feel that if the owner drives his car–and we are always being told that owners will drive, and not have chauffeurs–he will appreciate them.  A water circulation thermometer is a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>,’ but I find it very useful.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Somebody has suggested that the installation of thermostats, shutters, etc., is a confession of weakness; that a properly designed cooling plant ought to cool the car without the necessity for tinkering with it to meet the vagaries of the weather.  The fact is, of course, that overcooling is just as objectionable as constant boiling; and that the only way in which a proper mean can be maintained is by a system that modifies its cooling capacity according to the weather.  At the same time, the thing can be carried to an unnecessary degree of fineness.  During the season when thermostats are busy and shutters working overtime, while those who do not possess these <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> fall back mainly upon the use of newspaper and cardboard shields over the lower part of their radiators, the driver whose front-end design makes it possible for him to slip off his fan belt will be able to achieve much the same result in this way, and with a saving of power.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The painter of houses has always been puzzled for a way to plant his ladder against the side of the house without making a mark on the freshly laid paint.  A way to accomplish this is now offered him in the ingenious ladder-support illustrated.  On each upright of the ladder, near the tip, is clamped a curved brace, the other end of which is pointed.  These two points, one on either side of the ladder, furnish the bearing points for the ladder.  […] and they offer an extraordinarily convenient place from which to suspend the paint pot.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The famous Handley Page slotted wing, shown diagrammatically in our sketch, when open actually increases the maximum lift between fifty and seventy percent!  Its incorporation involves many mechanical difficulties, and aeronautical engineers always like to leave their wings free of all ‘<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>’ or complications.  Nevertheless, this tremendous increase in lift may very well be utilized one day either to diminish landing speeds or to increase the carrying capacity of our planes.”

He wrote only; about things he had experienced mostly outdoors, as a doctor’s son in northern Michigan and as a self-possessed young tramp in Europe.

But the device which may save life in one contingency will be useless in another and all submaries would be handicapped and their buoyancy seriously curtailed for the one problematical case when such apparatus would be useful.  […]  So the gain would be worse than doubtful.  considered purely from the viewpoint of personal safety, all naval officers prefer a ship which can fight to one cluttered up with ‘safety’ <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>; witness for instance the fact that a battleship carries no life boats.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In our July 1930 issue we described the very interesting experiments of Dr. Geer of Ithaca, whereby rubber, oil-impregnated airplane “overshoes” seem to have met the danger of ice formation.  It still remains to be seen whether practical aviators will resort to these overshoes.  Airmen have a horror of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, and operators may fear that the added cost and a possible decrease in aerodynamic efficiency will be prohibitive.  In the meantime it is the consensus that it is a very sound plan to warn the pilot that he is flying in a danger zone, namely where temperatures are between -4 degrees and 0 degrees, centigrade, and when he had better proceed to a zone of higher or lower temperatures.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In one type, deflectors, consisting of small airfoils, are placed at the side of the wind­ shield and slightly ahead of the screen proper. When these deflectors were turned into the wind, it was found by scientific wind tunnel test that the velocity of the wind outside the cockpit but in the lee of the deflector was reduced to negligible pro­ portions. Therefore the pilot could look out at the side of the cockpit without discomfort.  In another type the windshield is divided into two parts, and so arranged that the upper part can be staggered ahead of the lower part. Wind tunnel tests showed here that the air was deflected upwards with­ out any perceptible draught being felt in the cockpit, yet vision through the open­ ing was perfect. While open cockpits are now rarer than was the case a few years ago, anyone flying in an open ship might do worse than to ‘use one or the other of these two <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The true candid camera man is the most self-effacing chap on earth; the more he is ignored, the less he is observed, the better he likes it. Among the array of miniature cameras, accessories and wonder·working films and developing solutions that produce prints which would have been impossible only a few years ago, he wants for but one thing––some magic formula by which he might make himself invisible at will.  /  Lacking such a formula, however, the exigencies of his ‘now-you-see-me-now-you-don’t’ career have taught him many subterfuges, in which he is ably abetted by a number of ‘<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.’  One of the most useful of these is the so-called angle·view finder, a device which by means of mirrors enables the photographer to give the impression of aiming at something down the street while actually taking the picture of a subject standing at right angles to the photographer’s apparent vision.  A variation of this, where a low viewpoint is desired, is to point this finder straight down to the floor or sidewalk and become ostensibly immersed in the examination of some mechanical problem of the camera itself.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “His ‘crash rodeo,’ however, is more than an exhibition of nerve.  It is a demonstration of precise planning and of the value of mechanical safeguards.  For <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> play a stellar role in his escapes from death.”  i.e.:  “A sponge-rubber kneeling pad, of the type used by housewives and gardeners, is fastened to the top of the rear fender.  This enables the stunt man to remove the saddle post and sit far back on the machine, with his body low over the gas tank.  …  Another safety measure is a pad fastened tightly to the top of the motor-cycle frame.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “We have been accused of being a nation of <span class="red">gadget</span> collectors; collectors of camera accessories that are bought solely for the purpose of acquiring more <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  So what?  What finer <span class="red">gadget</span> can you acquire than a gleaming telephoto lens, a combination of steel, glass, and chromium that is beautiful to lok at, that functions like a piece of clockwork and that is a thrill to own?  Acquire your <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> if you can afford it.  Buy more lenses, more filters, more copying devices, lanterns, enlargers, and every other device you can afford if you will use them.  Learn how they operate; learn the function of every colored filter you get, try out the enlarger under every different condition you can think of and then you will have a real excuse in buying all the different things.  But, if you don’t use htem, then there is no excuse for them and eventually you will sell them to some other amateur who will make use of them and at a bargain.”  SAME ISSUE:  Beers, Nathan Thomas.  “The Miniature Camera”:  “<span class="red">Gadget</span>s and Short-Cuts.–In the ustle which frequently becomes necessary in the processing of exposures made in connection with one’s profesiosnal work, any <span class="red">gadget</span> or short-cut calculated to save time is certain to be acceptable.  There are many of us who have learned the convenience of the miniature camera in making photographic records…  […]  Figure 1 shows a little <span class="red">gadget</span> which has served us very satisfactorily as a rest or cradle in which to place the reel while being loaded.  The M-shaped section may be turned up of tin or aluminum, or made of wood.  Ours was made of a sheet of Monel metal and is mounted on a block of wood on the bottom of which four felt corn-plasters serve to give a little grip on the table or bench.  […]  Figure 2 shows how a tell-tale made by a bit of folded card, and slipped into the finder-=clip, tells at a glance exactly the contents of the film magazine or whether the camera be empty.  Where one makes use of two or more cameras of this type this little <span class="red">gadget</span> saves much time.  On one side may be printed or written the name of the film being used and on the reverse side the word ‘empty.’”

Asking if reporters could remember the old cyclometer that used to record mileage on bicycles, President Roosevelt proudly explained that this new contrivance worked after the same fashion, to measure the electricity used in a small house. And instead of costing $10.00 which is what the big meter costs, this new one would cost about halt that. Mr. Roosevelt was so pleased with it that he held it aloft from his swivel chair all the time he talked”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “When you look at the gun illustrated below, note particularly the two little <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> shown under the barrel and the similar <span class="red">gadget</span> on the end of the barrel.  The gun itself is a 20-gage, bolt-action, repeating shotgun with detachable clip of two-shot capacity–and a third in the chamber, if desired.  But the three little <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> comprise the crux of this story, for they are machined choke tubes, easily and quickly interchangeable, thereby producing a three-shot scattergun with full choke, modified choke, or improved cylinder choke, as may be desired.  And by shooting the gun without any tube attached, you get a true cylinder which, although offering no control over the pattern, is still preferred by some shooters.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The very names ‘dash’ or ‘splash’ board, which, it is believed, were synonymous as applied to earlier vehicles automatically explain the original intended use of this particular part of a vehicle body.  That is to say, it was the barrier erected between the horse as the means of propulsion and the passengers carried in the vehicle so propelled.  The only instrument likely to be found on these earliest vehicles was possibly a dashboard clock.”  …  “There appear to have been over a period of years two schools of thought of as regards dashboard equipment, the first extreme being in the direction of fitting the dashboard with almost every conceivable form of <span class="red">gadget</span> which the ingenuity of man has devised, amongst these instruments and knobs being some of the essential ones and many nonessential ones.  A rough list would comprise speedometer, clock. petrol gauge, revolution counter, oil pressure gauge, water thermometer, oil thermometer, ammeter, starter switch and light switches, dynamo-charging warning light, oil pressure warning light, cigar lighter, car heater, radio and choke controls, brake self-servo warning light, octane selector, and even such devices as trafficator indicators, time switch for lights, battery level indicators, radiator water level indicators, and possibly others which do not come to mind at the moment.  Even some of these have not been commercially produced.”

Schell, 1019 Third Avenue, Beaver Falls, Pa., is shown in Figure 5.  Asked to describe it, Schell writes:  ‘The drive is used with an equatorial which has for its upper polar bearing a large cast iron flange, or plate, which rolls on two ball-bearing rollers (Porters design, I believe).  I found it would be necessary to re-build the whole thing if a worm-wheel was to be used, so tried using a thin band or belt of phosphor-bronze (continuous) which passes around both rollers and under the large flange.  This band is just taut when the weight is on it.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Our fighter planes are almost as fast, and certainly as well protected and armed as any in the world, and are provided with every instrument, accessory, or <span class="red">gadget</span> that it is possible to think of. These planes also are exceedingly robust-far more robust that the almost “delicate” Zero, for example. There has, however, been a tendency in American fighter design to use too much strength and weight, too many <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, instruments, and ac­cessories, and finally, to load the wing, in pounds per square foot, to very high values. The result is they lack, perhaps, in maneuverability-the ability to roll, or to dive very rapidly when detaching them­ selves from the enemy.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “New crop includes everything from retrievers to mirrors to help the duffer approach par.  In the perennial pursuit of par, America’s three million golfers spend $40 million annually for equipment.  A surprisingly large proportion of this money goes for the scores of ingenious <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> which are supposed to help every duffer hit his tee shot a little farther, get on the green a little sooner, and putt a little bit straighter.  While some of these <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> help lower the golfer’s score, others soothe his sensitive nerves, like the ‘Retrevit’ which makes it simple to fish a poorly hit ball out of a stream.  In spite of the expenditures of cash and energy, however, less than .5% of all the golfers in the U.S. can shoot on par or under.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Women request mechanical <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that they can operate with a minimum of effort. And today’s car has been so tailored to the woman’s tastes that the automobile has taken on a whole new group of functions that men alone would not have dared to demand for themselves with such conveniences as power steering, power brakes, seating adjustments and electric window lifts.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Hush-A-Phone is a cup-like <span class="red">gadget</span>, on the market since 1921, which fits over the mouthpiece of a telephone.  Its purpose is to confine the user’s voice in the <span class="red">gadget</span>, thus rendering his conversation private and to keep extraneous noise out of the telephone line, making the circuit quieter.  …  Telephone companies claimed that the use of Hush-A-Phone violated their tariffs, which forbid the attachment to a telephone of any device ‘not furnished by the telephone company.’”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The late John von Neumann liked to cite this example of the relation between technological development and pure mathematics:  A hundred and fifty years ago one of the most important problems of applied science––on which development in industry, commerce and government depended––was the problem of saving lives at sea  The statistics of the loses were frightful.  The money and effort expanded to solve the problem were frightful too––and sometimes ludicrous.  No <span class="red">gadget</span>, however complicated, was too ridiculous to consider––ocean-going passenger vessels fitted out like outrigger canoes may have looked funny, but they were worth a try.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “If you’ve ever doubted that listening to good music at home is as much of a hobby as it is a pleasure, just cast an eve at the assortment of hi-fi accessories that POPULAR SCIENCE has assembled on these pages. We bought them to find out if these <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> really can improve the sound you hear. Here’s what we learned: Record cleaners. A minute speck of dust looks like a huge boulder to the tiny stylus in your stereo cartridge. Every time the stylus hits a dust speck as it races through a dirty record’s groove, the cartridge generates an output voltage spike that produces crackle and pop.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “It is worth extra money to know that when your washing machine begins that low moan that will end in a gasping jerk and a tub left full of water, you can call for a repairman and have a reasonable chance of having him show up on a not too distant date. In selecting any appliance, buy only the conveniences you need. Every extra working <span class="red">gadget</span> on an appliance increases the possibilities of things going wrong often, it seems, in geometric progression. Each appliance has certain basic functions for saving time and labor. Beyond these, think carefully about each additional feature to decide whether it will be of value to you. The top-of-the-line model in the middle or even the bottom line only in the number of extra, but minor, features plus a little trim here or there. Such features may or may not save time […]”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “But the device-which is designed to screen drunks by testing judgment, visual acuity, short-term memory and coordinated motor response-will also weed out drug users and those who are mentally or physically deficient. To satisfy the demanding <span class="red">gadget</span>, a driver must be able to read the relatively small lighted numbers, memorize them, recall them, and punch them into the keyboard in a coordinated response within a few seconds. If he can perform these functions he is fit for the road. If he cannot-in three tries-the tester shuts off for a half-hour, giving him time to sober up before another attempt. General Motors is aware that the public will not stampede to buy and install the testers, no matter how inexpensive they are.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In the tradition of the electric toothbrush and the high-speed electric cocktail mixer, the latest effort-saving <span class="red">gadget</span> is the Name Caller, which does away with the need of dialing a telephone. By pressing a button on the device, which can be easily attached to the phone, a user can reach any one of 38 numbers. Besides its speed and convenience, the Name Caller provides a foolproof way for a baby sitter to phone police, firemen or the family doctor in an emergency. The <span class="red">gadget</span>-about the size of a small bathroom scale-has been available for only four months in seven major markets.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “This, however, is a mere drop in the fuel tank when compared with the investments of the Unlimited pilots. Cliff Cummins, a Riverside, Calif. radiologist and consistently star-crossed flyer, estimates that he has sunk some $140,000 into his Mustang fighter in the years he has owned it. Cummins, who was once an Air Force gunnery instructor, belly-landed the Mustang in the Nevada desert three years ago during the Reno air races after a small throttle link snapped. The very same <span class="red">gadget</span> failed him on the sixth lap of the eight-lap semifinal heat in Miami on Saturday. Cummins was leading at the time and had recorded the fastest qualifying-heat time of 376.8 mph earlier in the week.”

First he would listen to the tape over and over again until he felt at home with the speech patterns-voice modulation as well as breathing space. When he was satisfied that he knew the voices as well as his own, he would do the easy part first-simply cutting out certain words or sentences with a razor blade and splicing the tapes together.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “An infinitesimal mechanical advantage can make the difference between a winning and a losing sled, and the snoops at Winterberg were hoping to catch a glimpse or a hint or a suggestion of a <span class="red">gadget</span> or an idea that an opposing team may have come up with since last season. It was a tense, watchful scene, worthy of a good suspense-filled cold war espionage movie. . . . Such was the superiority of the two supersled powers, that of the 18 medals awarded in the last three Olympics, 10 went to East Germany (including five of six golds) and five went to Switzerland. Two medals were won by West Germany and one by the U.S.S.R. // The international federation tried hard to halt this expensive technological race. But when it introduced new restrictions, Spezialtechnik would just come up with new <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that weren’t outlawed, and the Swiss, working alone in their garages, kept souping up their machines in a similar manner.”
