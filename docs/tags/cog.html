  <strong>Quote:</strong> “So we gaily essayed the passage, which Jim accomplished safely; but just as the Skipper was stepping off his bridge on to the bank the treacherous bark gave way (this is the worst danger in walking on fallen trees), and with a mighty splash he and his rifle went into the deepest hole in the creek.  He thought it best to get out at once, but too late to save his watch, which he opened, and found that the escapement had floated round to the back of the mainspring and jammed the <span class="red">gadget</span> that the chunkerblock would not work.  But we were equal to the emergency, and in two minutes had frizzled all the water out of the works by unscrewing the large lens of the binocular and using it as a burning glass.  It had a wonderful effect, and with a little coaxing the watch began to go; then we hung it on a tree with the mechanism still exposed to the rays of the sun, and went on our way rejoicing.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In order to unite these plates by close-fitting joints, the contact surfaces were machined.  At the centre of an ordinary segment a hole was tapped to receive a 1.25 inch pipe.  This was the grout hole.  […]  The lug which, with the Hudson Companies, formed an integral part of the ordinary segment, was here omitted.  A <span class="red">gadget</span> was employed instead, in connection with a corresponding pair of bolt holes near the centre.  The device furnished a means by which the mechanical erector controlled the plate.  However, a great deal of placing was done by hand, in spite of the fact that all pieces except the key weighed a ton each.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Fig. 14 shows method of erecting the segments on the upper quarter.  The segments were attached to the erector bar by a <span class="red">gadget</span> with a large nut on one plain screwed end, and a flanged spigot on the other; the nut was run back far enough to insert the <span class="red">gadget</span>, and the nut was spun by hand very quickly to lock it in place.  This is a very effective way of lifting the segments and saved the expense of casting iron lugs on each segment.  The cast iron in the four tunnels represents about 100,000 tons; each segment weight about one ton, so about 100,000 lugs were saved.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “If the conning tower is the brain of the ship, the engine-room is its heart.  When Jellicoe was speeding up to join Beatty and Evan-Thomas his whole fleet maintained a speed in excess of the trial speeds of some older vessels.  Think what skilful [sic] devotion this simple fact reveals, what minute attention day in day out for months and years, so that in the hour of need no mechanical <span class="red">gadget</span> may fail of its duty.  And as with Jellicoe’s Fleet so all through the war.  Whenever the engine-rooms have been tested up to breaking strain they have always, always, stood up to the test.  I think less of the splendid work done by destroyer flotillas, by combatant officers and men in th ebig ships, by all those who have manned and directed within the light cruisers.  Their work was done within sight; that of the engine-rooms was hidden.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The distortion of the ‘field section’ or ‘field sheet’ due to changes of humidity and temperature, has been a thorn in the side of the topographer for many years, neither does there appear to be any means of eliminating it as long as the field sheet is of paper, or Bristol board, mounted upon a wooden board.  […]  Indeed the feeling of many topographers is averse to the introduction of anything in the nature of a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>.’  In those countries where most of our plant table work is done breakdowns may be fatal.  Experiment has proved, however, that a simple but ingenious arrangement can be fitted to the existing pattern of legs which provides a slow motion, thrown in or out of action by a cam, and detachable at will.  It was tried in 1914 and unanimously approved of.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The multiplied troubles of the radio operator on board ship, and persistent complaints to the superintendent, have hurried the development of the break-key.  The name was a misfit for early devices with their multitude of levers, wires and contacts.  The delicacy of the equipment was responsible for periodic instruction from the company engineers not to tamper with the outfit.  /  The ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>,’ as it was disrespectfully called, sputtered and flashed at the contacts, and the noises circulating in the telephones further tried the patience of the operator.  Messages were received with uncertainty and traffic was frequently congested.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Trucks Make Their Own Fuel.  The accompanying photographs, showing a method of generating fuel gas for motor vehicles from charcoal, which has been rather extensively tried out in France, illustrates, to our mind, a tendency which has been apparent in Europe since the World War–a tendency to attempt to accomplish by complicated methods what is already being accomplished through simple means.  […]  The apparatus consists of a generating chamber having a grate, firebox and boiler for producing the necessary steam for making the gas.  It appears to be an amazing complication of internal ‘<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.’  The gas must be scrubbed, filtered to remove particles of charcoal, and further purified in a centrifugal purifier.  There are a number of other details which it seems unnecessary to mention here.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “You know, of course, that the weak radio impulse that reaches your set by way of the antenna is amplified or strengthened many times before it is converted into the electrical equivalent of sound that you can hear.  This strengthening of the radio signal is accomplished by passing it through several circuits, each of which consists, essentially, of a vacuum tube, a coil of wire, and a queer-looking metal <span class="red">gadget</span> with two sets of metal fins, called a condenser.  You have noticed how some of these fins slide in between others without actually coming into contact, when you turn the knob that tunes the stations.  Moving these fins, or condenser plates, governs the tuning of the individual stage of amplification.  The same result could be obtained by changing the number of turns in the coil of wire, but it is mechanically more convenient to do the tuning by moving the condenser plates.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The modern American prose in this volume has as its distinguishing mark a certain tone.  This tone is a compound of freshness, vigor, sprightliness, and a kind of good-natured sophistication.  Its style is easy, almost nonchalant; but under its smooth surface lies genuine techncial competence and sound writing craftsmanship.  /  The increasing popularity of this kind of writing is a tribute to its extraordinary effectivenes.  Whether used for a narrative summary of a news event, or for the intricate analysis of a biographical study, its charm attracts and holds the reader.  If we may predict, a command of its technique will become more an more necessary for the student who aspires to the pages of our better magazines or even to the columns of his college publications.”  …  Elsie Gregory Macgill, “What to Call an Airplane”:  “There are flying field terms galore for the airplane’s structural parts.  <span class="red">Gadget</span> is the panacea of all errors.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The “Stuka’s” deflector fork is the bomb rack <span class="red">gadget</span> which lowers the 1100- or 550-pound bomb so that it will clear the arc of the propeller blades when released. The bomb is carried snuggled up against the center section of the wing to diminish air resistance. When the pilot makes ready to dive, the rack is extended.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Neat little <span class="red">gadget</span> for mounting a diagonal in a Newtonian reflector is shown in Figure 5, which is self­ explanatory (“Hua-i neng ta ch’ien yen,” or, picture’s meaning can ex­ press a thousand words, in case your Chinese has become rusty). Developed by Max Burgdorf, Natchitoches, Louisiana, and made by Lorane Brit­tain and Sherwood Burgdorf, it takes the place of the more customary spider support for diagonals and would cause a less complicated diffraction pattern than the latter.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “If   the  sound  presented  was  the “wrong”  one, she was supposed to remain in this position.  If it was the right one, she was to knock on the lid of a switch box in front of her cage with her trunk:  this caused an electrical <span class="red">gadget</span> to bring a food  reward within reach of her trunk.  The experimenter sat behind a screen watching the animal by means of a mirror system.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “A  case  history  of a  schizophrenic  child  who  converted  himself into  a  “machine”  because  he  did  not  dare  be  human.  His  story sheds  light  on  emotional  development  in  a  mechanized  society.  […]  To counteract this fear we gave him a metal wastebasket in lieu of a toilet.  Eventually, when eliminating into the wastebasket, he no longer needed to take off all his clothes, nor to hold on to the wall.  He still needed the tubes and motors which, he believed, moved his bowels for him.  But here again the all-important machinery was itself a source of new terrors.  In Joey’s world the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> had to move their bowels, too.  He was terribly concerned that they should, but since they were so much more powerful than men, he was also terrified that if his tubes moved their bowels, their feces would fill all of space and leave no room to live.  He was thus always caught in some fearful contradiction.”

For  every  kind  of oscillator  that has  been  put  to  work  at  least  a  dozen other  kinds  repose  on  laboratory  shelves as  interesting but useless  <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “. It was dull, and bare of anything more than a pale flecking of dust. When it was time for the little boys’ suppers Clay took them upstairs and gave them their baths in the same water. “ Why do I always have to have a bath with Johnnie? “ said the bigger boy furiously as the small boy dug strong toes into his bare back. “ Because, “ Clay patiently explained, “ we don’t want to use more hot water than we must. Every time we turn on the hot water it makes the <span class="red">gadget</span> in the cellar go, and every time that goes it costs money. We must spend as little as possible. “ “’ Cause you’re home with us all the time? “ the bigger boy asked, looking wisely into his father’s serious face. “ That’s it, “ Clay said shortly. “ Shame, Martie, “ Lucia said when they came downstairs in their clean pajamas. “ Shame for what? “ “ Shame for pestering Daddy, “ she said indignantly. “”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Rumor said that Mussolini might visit Avigliani, and an old fogy in the tavern on Piedmont Lane swore that he had seen him in the village, his heavy chin covered with a dense growth of beard so as to escape recognition. Giovanni followed the call of higher wages and set out for Torino, promising his mother an easier life. The automobile factory hired him, and he served the machine all day, adjusting to the cars a <span class="red">gadget</span> which looked like a pair of skates. At first he thought his back would break in two. Once or twice he collapsed with fatigue and the foreman swore at him in the choice dialect of Calabria, which he did not understand. But after a few weeks Giovanni became used to his servitude and even began to find comfort in the quiet irresponsibility of his work. He earned far more than he could have made in his native village, and part of his money went to his mother.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Creators of intelligent artificial brains, said Williams, should strive for machines that are designed and built specially for abstract thinking. The necessary hardware will soon be available: electronic units, analogous to brain cells, that can be produced by the billion, be made too small to see with a microscope, send 100 million signals per second, never make mistakes and last indefinitely. Computers made of these wonderful <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and geared for abstract thought should be able to outthink the brightest human brain.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The electronic <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> so vital to vehicles in far-out space suffer from some far-out troubles. Cosmic radiation sickens their semiconductors. Vibrations and swift temperature changes cause fractures in all-important wires. Lubricants evaporate into the vacuum of space. But scientists are already working on some far-out cures. The latest: a tin-magnesium-aluminum alloy that can be made into wires that grow gap-bridging “ whiskers “ when broken and soon heal their own wounds.”
