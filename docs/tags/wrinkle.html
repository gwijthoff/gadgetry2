  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Aviator boys of twenty and eighteen had not thought of any motto at all, but they live up to it.  Their only pass words are ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ and ‘stunt,’ they show you in delight this and that bit of machinery, and it is a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>,’ and they do their ‘stunts’–eights and inside edges in the air, they seemed to me…  […] The <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and stunts we have invented for our aviation and observation and photography are marvellous.  Each officer shows you his own invention with a boy’s delightful pride, devices for signalling, quick methods for flying camp records, codes for announcing each shell where it falls,tricks for simplifying map reading.  Something like Y.12.15 sent by wireless means that a shell has burst within so many yards of such an enemy position, and in a certain direction.  The precision of aeroplane photographs is wonderful.  I saw those of Guillemont before and after our shelling.  Before, the minute map of the village; after, a square piece of pockmarked skin; that is exactly what it looked like, with the requisite patience one could have exactly counted the shell holes.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Finally, there is the ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>,’ which is employed when insufficient fall [gravitational momentum] is available, in order to push the packages along.”  (209)  “The ‘<span class="red">Gadget</span>.’ – A ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ is illustrated in Figs. 302 to 304 (Rownson, Drew, &amp; Clydesdale’s patent).  This device comes into play principally when a sufficient gradient for a gravity runway is unobtainable, and where, therefore, a very slight incline or even a level path, has to be chosen.  A ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ may likewise be used for an uphill gradient for stacking purposes (see Fig. 305), or it may take the place of a ‘humper’; generally speaking, a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ will push a steady stream of cases for about 200 ft. on a level path.  This device is made 8 ft. long in order that it may replace an 8-ft. section of a runway without necessitiating any rearrangement of the rest of the lay-out.  The machine consists of an angle frame which may stand on a level floor in case of a stationary installation, or may be mounted on wheels for a portable lay-out; it totally elcloses the elctro-motor and the propelling device.  […]  It would not be practicable for the ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ to push cases round the corner; the path must always be in a straight line.  If angles have to be negotiated, this must be done on a gravity run after the cases leave, independently of the pushing influence of the ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>.’”

Obviously he belonged to that large brotherhood which loves a <span class="red">gadget</span>. Quick to appreciate ingenious novelties, he picked them up wherever he found them, and not only brought them home, but he improved them. One such contrivance was an attachment which he found in Milan, for the hub of his carriage wheel to tell the nummer of revolutions made obviously the granddaddy of the modern speedometer. Another was a polygraph, a writing machine, which made two copies with only one writing (see Color Plate XXIV). Jefferson improved on this, so that his polygraph”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In the course of a post mortem on the late and generally lamented international yacht races, a London newspaper remarked that ‘British seamanship was defeated by Yankee <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.’ This referred, of course, to the fact that the ‘Enterprise’ used various mechanical labor-saving devices for the speedy raising and lower of sails, whereas the ‘Shamrock’ relied exclusively on old-fashioned elbow grease. / Hollywood’s position of leadership in the celluloid world is invariably attributed to the superiority of ‘Yankee <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>’—the sound recording apparatus behind the greatest <span class="red">gadget</span> of all. / There is plenty of truth in this. For this development of the purely mechanical part of film production in Hollywood has become one of the major miracles of history. If only some of the other departments had kept pace with this development . . . but there is no point in indulging in depressing and fruitless speculation. [. . . ] There has been much talk lately of the dreadful mechanical Robot that is ruining Art in our modern civilization. Our finer aesthetic sensibilities, we are told, are being mangled in the ruthless cog-wheels of the Machine Age. / Insofar as Hollywood is concerned, however, it is the Robot, the Spirit of the <span class="red">Gadget</span>, that most nearly approaches that goal of perfection toward which all art strives. / How often do we see pictures in which the technical qualities—the photography, sound reproduction, mechanical effects—are inferior to the flesh, the blood and the grey matter? Almost never. For an excellent example of just what I mean, have a look at ‘Hell’s Angels.’”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “If technique is, as Mark Twain suggested, doing something simple in a complicated way, then a wrinkle suggests the reverse of this; that is, a simple method of doing something complicated.  If a botanist requires several complex solutions to stain certain fibbers, that is technique.  Another botanist’s suggestion that he would get the same result with a drop of marking ink is a wrinkle.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “We often wonder when Jackson Rose sleeps. Jack is one of Hollywood’s best known cameramen. But he is equally well known for his creation of new <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and devices to aid in the cinematographic field. Some time ago he brought out a focus chart that created much interest. Now he has improved upon that chart and has produced a <span class="red">gadget</span> that should prove a very valuable adjunct to any cameraman’s equipment. It is a combination focus chart and scene slate. On one side is the chart, on the other the slate. The entire <span class="red">gadget</span> is of a heavy quality fabrakoid. The entire chart and slate folds up and when ready for packing or putting in the pocket is 12 inches x 4 3/4 inches in size. On the outside of the <span class="red">gadget</span> is a place for the camera report for the laboratory. The device should be very valuable on location trips.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “I have found Americans out,’ writes a dear English friend, who is a good deal of a wag.  ‘They are <span class="red">gadget</span>-minded.  If they see a thing that needs to be done, they rig up a device, mechanical or mental, and make the thing do itself with no further bother.’  /  ‘As a result,’ he goes on,’ they have created a touch-the-button civilization, and I for one admire it.  Why go on doing a thing in the same old way, over and over again, if we can make a robot do it for us, and do it better?  My hat is of to the <span class="red">gadget</span> mind.’  /  To prove his point he refers to the Mark Twain story of the Connecticut Yankee at the Court of King Arthur.  The Yankee saw a saint swaying to and fro in an ecstasy of devotion, and to him it was a clear case of lost motion.  So he sat about and invented a device by which to harness the saint and use his motions to run a sewing machine.  In other words, he put religion to a practical use.  /  But, my friend goes on to say, there are some fields in which the <span class="red">gadget</span> mind will not work; and here he gets under our skin a bit.  We tried to achieve temperance by prohibition, and it failed.  We passed the law, wrote it into the Constitution and thought that the thing was done, and would stay done, or else would go on doing itself.  /  In the same way, he adds–rubbing it in rather sharply–we proposed the Pact of Paris; just another glorious <span class="red">gadget</span>.  We wrote a law outlawing war, renouncing it as a policy of nations.  The Law was solemnly signed; an dew thought the thing was done once for all.  But, alas, we see now that much remains to be done before war is ended.  /  In other words, my friend argues rightly, something more than a <span class="red">gadget</span> mind is needed to deal with the issues now before mankind.  It cannot be done by a twist of the wrist or the turn of a trick, much less by touching a button.  We need vision, and the courage, wisdom and patience to work it out, though it may take a long time.  /  Yes, the <span class="red">gadget</span> mind is useful in its place; it can do many things.  But the spiritual mind, God-illumined, is the hope of the race.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “But if a <span class="red">gadget</span> is a machine, an invention, a mechanical means of achieving a result, a wrinkle is a method of procedure.  Again our lexicographer, rating the word as colloquial, one step higher than slang, describes it as ‘a curious or ingenious notion; happy thought.’  I will accept that phrase ‘happy thought’ as particularly pat.  But to the seaman, a <span class="red">gadget</span> is a thing, and a wrinkle is a method, and both of them for most part unusual and unstandardized.” (viii))  /  That a <span class="red">gadget</span> is a solution that arises naturally out of the materials of the ship – similar to distinction made in US Court of Appeals case on the difference between a <span class="red">gadget</span> and an invention:  “In the long centuries in which men have sailed the seas, they have faced and solved oft-recurring problems.  When these problems present themselves on every passage and on every tack, the means of solving them are built right into the ship or her rigging.  ut when, as so often occurs, the problem arises out of some unusual situation, the sailor is forced to turn inventor.  He calls upon all his ingenuity.  He summons to his aid his past experience with the solution of some similar problem.  And perhaps he remembers, with that strange race memory which is often mis-called instinct, some similar experience of a sea-going ancestor.”  /  “Our lexicographers define a <span class="red">gadget</span> as ‘anything the name of which cannot be recalled at the moment,’ and in parentheses, they add (Slang, U.S. Navy.)  But the name has a broader meaning and a riper antiquity than the dictionary credits.  I believe the term is older than the navy itself, ad far too deeply imbedded in the language to merit the transitory stigma of slang.  A landsman’s synonyms for <span class="red">gadget</span> are thing-um-bob, widget, what-do-yer-call-it, do-funny.  A sailor’s synonym is gilhickey, although a purist would make a distinction by never using the term gilhickey except to distinguish one <span class="red">gadget</span> from another.  The first <span class="red">gadget</span> is the <span class="red">gadget</span>.  The second <span class="red">gadget</span> in any situation in which two appear is the gilhickey.”  (viii)  /  The temporality/longevity/life-span of a <span class="red">gadget</span>–“But it must not be considered that the term is applied merely as a temporary substitute for an object’s true name.  Most of the unusual things about a ship go nameless forever.  When an invention becomes so standardized that it acquires a name, it ceases to be a <span class="red">gadget</span> except for those brief periods when its distinguishing name is forgotten.  But there are thousands of unusual things about a ship or a yacht that were born <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and will remain <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> as long as they are used.  They are the inventions that solve the rare problems, the machines that are unnecessary on most vessels and at most times and are therefore nameless.” That at any moment, a <span class="red">gadget</span> could become a wrinkle and vice versa–the difference between a tool and a procedure is not readily identifiable:  “I have been sore put to it to organize this book.  For I am dealing with concepts that have thus far resisted organization so well that they have avoided being tagged with names.  Also it is pretty hard to tell where a <span class="red">gadget</span> begins and a wrinkle ends or vice versa.  Take a familiar example.  You are about to tie two lines together.  You tie them into a weaver’s knot.  Standard practice so far–no <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, no wrinkles.  The nrealizing that ther eis going to be a terrific strain on that line and that the knot will be pulled so tight that you will never be able to untie it again, you decide to slip a toggle into the knot.  That’s a happy thought, for you can always take a hammer and drive out the toggle and the knot will be loose.  What is that toggle–a winkle or a <span class="red">gadget</span>?  Now suppose we decide that the strain is going to be so great that it will be difficult to drive out an ordinary toggle.  So we use a large fid whose sloping shape assures us that the slightest driving with the hammer will loosen the knot.  Is the wrinkle now a <span class="red">gadget</span>?  Or if the small end of the fid is greased to make it slip more easily through the the tight turns of the knot, does it become a wrinkle again?  I don’t know and I don’t pretend to try to find out.  The line of demarkation is too indistinct.  So I shall write about <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and wrinkles without worrying much about branding them with their proper names.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “From now on we shall see a rapid development of electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eering–the non-radio application of radio technique–according to Charley Golenpaul, of the Aerovox Corporation.  /  “I believe the era of electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eering is now opening up in a big way,” states Mr. Golenpaul. “In the first place, the ban on amateur radio communications is not going to leave the enterprising ‘ham’ twirling his thumbs.  Of course many ‘hams’ are already or will soon be in our armed and technical services.  Many will find wartime jobs with other United Nations.  But those remaining on the home front are going to put their experience, equipment, and ambition to work on new and startling applications in the home, shop, factory, and elsewhere, far removed from customary radio practice.  /  “I suppose most radio men have heretofore been too busy with radio proper to find extra time and energy for non-radio or electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eering possibilities. However, many of them now are going to use their ‘rigs’ and parts for new functions.  I can visualize some interesting developments – light-beam telephones for conversing over considerable distances; automatic photo-electric garage-door openers; photo-electric switches turning lights on and off with darkness or daylight; checking the stoking of furnaces or boilers by the chimney smoke; various comparators or instruments for comparing and matching colors and shades; checking solution concentrations and chemical studies by conductivity means; and so on.  /  “As a starter, electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eer­ing can be based on well-known ele­mentary principles and basic circuits long known to radio amI electrical workers. Many industrial plants are already electronic-<span class="red">gadget</span> conscious. I know of radio servicemen who’ve got­ ten themselves good jobs in plants he­ cause of their ability to do things better, quicker, and less expensively by electronic means.  /  “Make no mistake about it, the temporary suspension of ‘ham’ communications may well turn out to he a boost. It will generate a lively in­terest in electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eering. And when ‘ham’ communications are re­sumed again with the return of peace, I venture to predict that electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eering will comprise a greater field for radio parts, particularly the quality or extra-heavy-duty compo­nents, than all amateur radio activities put together. Furthermore, many a ‘ham’ will find an interesting way of making real money out of his hobby, and that’s something.””

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The homely Philadelphian, often treated by historians as a politician with a spare-time interest in <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, was actually one of the great experimental scientists. […]  It is often said that Franklin’ was typically American in his approach to science-a utilitarian interested in science chiefly, if not solely, because of its prac­tical applications. It is true that when he had discovered the action of pointed grounded conductors and proved that clouds are electrified, he applied these discoveries to the invention of the lightning rod. But he did not make these dis­coveries in order to invent a lightning rod! Franklin’s inventions were of two kinds. One type was pure <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span>; in this class were his inventions of bifocal glasses, which required no recondite knowledge of optical principles, and of a device for taking books down from the shelf without getting up from one’s chair. The lightning rod, on the other hand, de­veloped from pure scientific research. If Franklin’s approach to science had been strictly utilitarian, it is doubtful that he would ever have studied the subject of electricity at all. In the 18th century there was only one practical application of electricity, and that was the giving of electric shocks for therapeutic purposes, chiefly to cure paralysis.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Besides its many handsome diagrams and striking photographs, it possessed a side pocket containing a collapsible, multicolored dodecahedron (held to­gether by rubber bands which made it self-erecting when removed from its hid­ ing place), a set of motion-picture ‘cards which when rapidly riffled displayed cer­tain geometrical laws, a pair of red and green Cagliostro spectacles which con­ferred three dimensions on the book’s several anaglyphs, and a few other equally ingenious <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>. Dr. Steinhaus’ introduction was so modest and amiable as to disarm all criticism. “You are right,” he said, “there is no system in this book; important things are omitted and trifles are emphasized. Many things do not deserve the name of mathematics, and the author himself does not seem to know what his aim really was in publish­ ing his ‘mathematical snapshots.’ They are too scientific for a child and too childish for a mathematician.” Still, this was excessively modest. For Steinhaus succeeded not only in serving up a re­ past of mathematical objects “as pecu­liar as the most exotic beast or bird,” but his book, for all its grab-bag disorder and despite the fact that his morsels rarely more than tickled the appetite for the strange and wonderful, afforded an amazing display of the richness, the va­riety and especially the interrelatedness of mathematical thought. His snapshots had a dual role. They were often beau­tiful and fascinating in themselves and from that standpoint it was unnecessary to ask what they meant. Yet they were also pictorial representations of purely abstract relations possessing universal validity. Thus they could illumine for the thoughtful reader something of the nature of intellectual process-how we are able to interpret the physical world and make coherent and useful systems describing its behavior. The very mish­ mash quality of the book serves to carry out this purpose.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “The attempts through the years to get a broader, looser conception of patents than the Constitution contemplates have been persistent.  The Patent Office, like most administrative agencies, has looked with favor on the opportunity which the exercise of discretion affords to expand its own jurisdiction.  And so it has placed a host of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> under the armor of patents – <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that obviously have had no place in the constitutional scheme of advancing scientific knowledge. A few that have reached this Court show the pressure to extend monopoly to the simplest of devices:  Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 248: doorknob made of clay, rather than metal or wood, where different shaped door knobs had previously been made of clay.  Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v. Howard, 20 Wall. 498: rubber caps put on wood pencils to serve as erasers.  Union Paper Collar Co. v. Van Dusen, 23 Wall. 530: making collars of parchment paper where linen paper and linen had previously been used.  Page 340 U. S. 157  Brown v. Piper, 91 U. S. 37: a method for preserving fish by freezing them in a container operating in the same manner as an ice cream freezer.  Reckendorfer v. Faber, 92 U. S. 347: inserting a piece of rubber in a slot in the end of a wood pencil to serve as an eraser.  Dalton v. Jennings, 93 U. S. 271: fine thread placed across open squares in a regular hairnet to keep hair in place more effectively.  Double-Pointed Tack Co. v. Two Rivers Mfg. Co., 109 U. S. 117: putting a metal washer on a wire staple.”  etc. etc.  “The patent involved in the present case belongs to this list of incredible patents which the Patent Office has spawned. The fact that a patent as flimsy and as spurious as this one has to be brought all the way to this Court to be declared invalid dramatically illustrates how far our patent system frequently departs from the constitutional standards which are supposed to govern.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Well, I do it thisaway. The glass rotates while the template slides over it, back and forth. The linkage keeps the template always vertical. Throw on the abrasive and both glass and template automatically go paraboloid, the only curve we know of that can be made that way. Starting, say, with a hemisphere, or any segment of a sphere, and a thin, circular template, you can keep going and get any focal length you want. Of course, the above is a convex paraboloid but it works equally well on a concave one.  /   The reason why this <span class="red">gadget</span> works this way lies in the equation of the pa­raboloid and the fact that every section cut from a paraboloid, like a, b, c, d, e, is a parabola and all are identical.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “Appellee-plaintiffs sued for the infringement of three patents relating to steering gear idler arm assemblies of automobiles. Appellants-defendants,2  asserted that the patents were invalid because of lack of invention and that there was no infringement. The trial court upheld validity, found and enjoined infringement, and ordered an accounting. Later Jamco was found to be in contempt for violation of the injunction.  […]  [<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> as commonsense solution to a problem:]  Jamco asserts that these devices do not constitute invention, were anticipated by the prior art, and at the most show only mechanical improvements which should have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art.  […]  The crucial issue is whether ‘the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.’  […]  The dividing line between what results from mechanical ability and what displays inventive genius is ill-defined. Perhaps no hard and fast definitive rule can or should be established. We have here combination patents utilizing such well and commonly known elements as bearings, grease seals, washers, bushings, nuts and bolts. In Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 151, and 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 129, 95 L.Ed. 162, it was said that ‘the concept of invention is inherently elusive when applied to combination of old elements’ and that ‘courts should scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.’  […] Recognizing that patentability is a question of law for the court,13  we cannot say that here there is a <span class="red">gadget</span> as opposed to an invention. Certainly in a particular environment, the steering mechanism of motor vehicles, the peculiar and difficult problem of stabilizing that mechanism and protecting if from undue wear is solved in an expert, inexpensive and effective manner which attains an improved result. If the distinctive arrangement of the known elements would be apparent to a skilled mechanic, such fact is established neither by an examination of the devices nor by the evidence adduced at the trial. From the record presented to us the novel and distinctive combinations which make up the three patents in question require ‘greater skill and higher thought than would be expected of an ordinary mechanic trained in the art.’14  In the circumstances, Jamco has not sustained the burden of overcoming the presumption of validity by clear and convincing evidence.”

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “In the A&amp;P case, Justice Douglas writes a concurring opinion in which he speaks scornfully of simple ‘<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>,’ not worthy of patents, and implies that the atomic bomb was a great invention.  Perhaps courts, so far as possible, should leave mechanical theories to mechanics and engineers and theories on science to scientists.  There is always the chance that what may appear a subtle mechanical theory to a jurist may be obvious to even an apprentice, or what may appear to be sound science to him may be foolish to even a freshman in science.”  “parable of the raft of two logs”  “When the raft of two logs rested on the surface of the water, two natural forces were at work upon each log.  The force of gravity acting upon each log held it down upon the water and its buoyancy, responding to the law of displaced liquids, held it up.  When some force acted to overturn the raft, these two natural forces were brought into conflict, because either one log would have to rise against the law of gravity, or one would have to sink against the law of displaced liquids, before the raft could overturn.  To the extent that the two forces acted against each other, an entire new force, stability, wasp resent in the raft.  /  For good or evil, great as the invention of the atomic bomb may have been, the general invention produced no new force; it only released forces already present in nature.  /  The chieftain may only have produced a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ in the raft, but it still embodied a force which did not have even an incorporeal former existence.  /  Countless such forces are embodied in the mechanical devices that surround us.  Such forces are more fantastic than the fairies and genii who served favored mortals in the tales of the Arabian Nights.  Yet they are real.  They serve by the dozen in every American home, but, to legal sophisticates, the devices which embody them are only ‘<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.’”  Cites Reckendorfer v. Faber 1975 decision about pencil with eraser tip, and the simple, logical language used in that decision to decide whether or not a combination of two existing elements constitutes a new “force,” and ultimately a patentable invention.  Admires the simple language, written for a general public, of Justice Hunt’s decision, wishes Douglas had consulted it.  Hunt:  “The combination to be patentable must produce a different force or effect, or result in the combined forces or process, from that given by the separate parts.  There must be a new result produced by their union: if not, it is only an aggregation of old elements.”  Ends up arguing that lead pencil and attached rubber that “Not only is there no new result, but there is no joint operation.”  “

  <strong>Quote:</strong> “With  high  electrical  power  one  can generate extremely strong  magnetic fields,  but  the  difficulty  is  that  such fields place  severe  strains  on  the coil,  or solenoid, as  it  is  called.  A magnetic field can  produce  both mechanical  and heat­ing  effects.  The  mechanical  effects  are illustrated  by  a  clever  <span class="red">gadget</span>  known as Roguet’s  spiral.  It  is a  suspended  coil with  its  lower  end  dipping  into  a  bowl of  mercury.  When  a  current  passes through  the  coil,  the  magnetic  field around  the  loops  causes  the  adjacent turns  of  the  coil  to  be  attracted  to  each other  while  the  opposite  sides  of  each loop  repel  each  other.”

The nuclei of hydrogen atoms (protons) are, in effect, tiny magnets, and they line up like compass needles parallel to the earth’s magnetic field.

Buried objects that affect the field show up plainly.”

There were nothing but blank minds all around until he put some thought into it and said, Why don’t you try so-and-so?’ Then he’d go away. He wouldn’t even be interested enough to see if it worked. But it always did. Always!”
