  <strong>Springer, J.F., 1910.</strong>
  “In order to unite these plates by close-fitting joints, the contact surfaces were machined.  At the centre of an ordinary segment a hole was tapped to receive a 1.25 inch pipe.  This was the grout hole.  […]  The lug which, with the Hudson Companies, formed an integral part of the ordinary segment, was here omitted.  A <span class="red">gadget</span> was employed instead, in connection with a corresponding pair of bolt holes near the centre.  The device furnished a means by which the mechanical erector controlled the plate.  However, a great deal of placing was done by hand, in spite of the fact that all pieces except the key weighed a ton each.”

  “No lug was cast on the segments for attachment to the erector, but in its place the <span class="red">gadget</span> shown on Fig. 4, Plate LXX, was inserted in one of the pairs of bolt holes near the center of the plate, and was held in position by the running nut at one end.”

  “Further, at Cape Evans there had been running for more than three months a scientific station, which rivaled in thoroughness and exactitude any other such station in the world.  I hope that later a more detailed account may be given of this continuous series of observations, some of them demanding the most complex mechanism, and all of the watched over by enthusiastic experts.  It must here suffice to say that we who on our return saw for the first time the hut and its annexes completely equipped were amazed; though perhaps the <span class="red">gadget</span> which appealed most to us at first was the electric apparatus by which the cook, whose invention it was, controlled the rising of his excellent bread.”

  “This is a political tract, set in a boiler-room (similar to those in coal-burning vessels of the time) in Hell where various souls are being punished for their sins.  “‘Harnessed up the tide–the cool, big, wet, deep, blue, sparkling sea.  I believe they did it on the pneumatic principle, not on the hydraulic, if you’re interested in those things.’  ‘I ain’t,’ Mr. Sugden retorted.  ‘I’m only concerned with outstanding social facts.  We leave machinery to the intellectuals.’  ‘That’s very kind of you.

  <strong>Japp, Henry, 1912.</strong>
  “Fig. 14 shows method of erecting the segments on the upper quarter.  The segments were attached to the erector bar by a <span class="red">gadget</span> with a large nut on one plain screwed end, and a flanged spigot on the other; the nut was run back far enough to insert the <span class="red">gadget</span>, and the nut was spun by hand very quickly to lock it in place.  This is a very effective way of lifting the segments and saved the expense of casting iron lugs on each segment.  The cast iron in the four tunnels represents about 100,000 tons; each segment weight about one ton, so about 100,000 lugs were saved.”

  <strong>March, Michael S., 1912.</strong>
  “A sound way to appraise the validity of a proposed budgetary <span class="red">gadget</span> is to examine the value system of its architect. Budget systems are not neutral. They are designed on the basis of particular presuppositions as to the objectives of budget control, although these assumptions may be implicit rather than explicit. Different architects of budgetary systems may espouse different sets of values, and for this reason may have trouble in agreeing on a common blueprint.”

  ““Having personally searched through the British patents before taking out my own, I can well understand your objection to ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ stabilisers. Only one or two, if any, of the inventions ot be found there bear the stamp of the practical man, few appear to be products of men who had had any experience of aeroplanes, mostly the inventor seems to have had a ‘nebulous fancy which passed with him for thought.’ None the less, when one considers how cheaply such an apparatus as I have suggested could be put to the test, it seems a pity that we should not learn whatever it has to teach us, always bearing in mind that experimental mechanism must be capable of instant disconnection at the pilot’s discretion.” / A well known aviator writes:–“I must give vent to my feelings about ‘<span class="red">gadget</span> stabilisers.’ First of all I must admit ot being prejudiced against any such thing. Not only would any such device give me ‘cold feet,’ but probably cold hands as well, having nothing to do with them, in the shape of stick wagging, etc., but seriously there is one point which I do not think anybody has yet brought up, and that is this: With the arrival of the fool-proof aeroplane, which the birth of ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ devices seems to herald, there will have also to arise, and probably will, a fool (not proof) market to buy them. This, as it should be, is good for trade, but m yfear is that with the arrival of this class of buyer there is a grave danger of there arising a host of incompetent builders, who each and all will strive to turn out a cheap machine, and in this ambition they will be most undesirably assisted by the ‘<span class="red">gadget</span> stabiliser,’ for instead of spending money on designing a machine properly, any old thing with wings will do, if fitted with some patent <span class="red">gadget</span> which will do it for them. But what about it, if this <span class="red">gadget</span> jams or dislocates itself, as all such things must do some time or other?””

  “Of the making of motor accessories anything that can be screwed or stuck on to any part of a car under the claim of increasing the efficiency of that part—like the making of books, there is no end. Most of them outweigh by their certain cost and manifest complication, any advantage their use could obtain. I make however, an exception of the tell-tale type of <span class="red">gadget</span>, as prevention of trouble is better than the cure which at the same time may kill. One of these is an overheating tell-tale in the form of a plug set into the water circulation, electrically connected with a tiny red lamp on the dash board—which I saw at a depot for American accessories in Shaftesbury Avenue W.C.”

  “Imagine sitting outside a Dreadnought and trying to stabilise it with external <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, in the shape of water-ailerons worked by a lever from the bridge an da series of relay mechanisms! / Incidentally, “automatically” stable machines, consisting of aeroplanes of the present type stabilised by means of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> such as gyroscopes, pendula, and so forth, do not seem very promising.”

  <strong>Bacon, Gertrude, 1915.</strong>
  “There are rival methods of achieving this end, some constructors (among them Orville Wright in America) seeking to attain it by ‘automatic’ and others by ‘inherent’ stability.  The latter speak disrespectfully of the devices of the former; they call them ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ stabilizers.  The word is a trifle obscure, inasmuch as ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ is the sea term for any miscellaneous article which does not appear to have a definite name, or at least one which comes ready at the moment.  I asked a famous expert the other day to define a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span> stabilizer,’ and he did s promptly and forcibly as ‘any old thing which you hang on.’  Less picturesquely an automatic stabilizer is some means of giving stability, such as a gyroscope or a pendulum, which is put to a machine, and is not in itself an essential part of its construction.  /  The inherent stability people maintain that by careful design and constructino alone, by theorist and practical man working side by side, by scientific disposal of weights and surfaces, different tendencies may be made to balance and correct each other, one set of oscilations to damp out another, and so the perfect machine be evolved.  Further they have proved their point by succeeding.  The naturally stable machine is no dream of to-morrow but the realization of to-day; not sprung upon us in a moment by some fresh epoch-making discovery, but now arrived at as the consummation of the labours which began with the earliest pioneers.”

  “There seems to be, or have been, three devices for accomplishing this result, i.e.:  1st, The Churchill ‘<span class="red">Gadget</span>.’  2nd, The new Nesbit ‘Standard’ Compress.  3rd, The Webb High Density Attachment.  The first (Churchill ‘<span class="red">Gadget</span>’) does not seem to be actively offered and is apparently not a live prospect.  The second (Nesbitt Press) is a new style of compress, the process of which differs somewhat from the compress in general use.  They ahve one or two plants in experimental operation.  The third (Webb High Density Attachment) is intended for use in connection with their regular compresses.  The Webb compress is in general use and their attachment is in successful operation at a number of places.”

Each officer shows you his own invention with a boy’s delightful pride, devices for signalling, quick methods for flying camp records, codes for announcing each shell where it falls,tricks for simplifying map reading.  Something like Y.12.15 sent by wireless means that a shell has burst within so many yards of such an enemy position, and in a certain direction.  The precision of aeroplane photographs is wonderful.  I saw those of Guillemont before and after our shelling.  Before, the minute map of the village; after, a square piece of pockmarked skin; that is exactly what it looked like, with the requisite patience one could have exactly counted the shell holes.”

And as with Jellicoe’s Fleet so all through the war.  Whenever the engine-rooms have been tested up to breaking strain they have always, always, stood up to the test.

It simply meant that as soon as the sound was judged to be near enough the two guns only had to open fire, to keep pouring out bullets to make sure that the Huns had to fly through the stream and ‘stop one’ or more.

When he is prepared to go, shuts the bird-cage with his toe, moves a <span class="red">gadget</span> with his knee–regulates the speed, you see–pulls the bell cord with his teeth, lest some folks get caught beneath.  That would throw ‘er off the track; maybe flop ‘er on ‘er back.  Calls out names of every street, punches transfers with his feet.  Thus he earns his daily pay, running cars out Summit Way.”

  “You know, in the marines, when we can’t think of a generic name for anything, we call it a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ or a ‘gilguy.’  Now, this man has won two Congressional Medals and has another coming.  When we sighted the French coast, I was standing, where he could n’t see me, just behind him; and I heard him say: ‘I got two o’ them <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> now, an’ one on its way.  I wonder if I’ll get another over here.”

  “But what I should like to know is, what the deuce is a doo-hickie?’  ‘A doo-hickie?’ replied the squadron commander.   ‘A doo-hickie?  H’m’m.  George, how would you describe a doo-hickie?’  The officer appealed to puffed his pipe in silence for a moment [sic].  ‘Well,’ he said at length, ‘you know more or less what a <span class="red">gadget</span>’s like?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘And a gilguy?’  ‘Yes.’  ‘Well, a doo-hickie is something like that, only smaller as a rule.’ […]  The Stranger within the Gates of the Navy-that-Flies had the drink, and from then onwards forebore to ask any more questions.  But he still sometimes wonders what the functions of a doo-hickie might be.”

  “There she was.  And there he was.  In fact, putting it another way, there they both were.  And now jolly well what?

The wheeze was, in a sense, straightforward and uncomplicated.  What he wanted to do was to point out to the injured girl all that hung on her.  He wished to touch her heart, to plead with her, to desire her to restate her war-aims, and to persuade her–before three o’clock, when that stricken gentleman would be stepping into the pitcher’s box to loose off the first ball against the Pirates–to let bygones be bygones and forgive Augustus Biddle.”

  “But the Rolls-Royce Company would never pay big dividends upon the patronage or custom of the minority who buy their cars as toys–to play with all the intriguing little <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> with which they are fitted.”  (124)  /  “The motor car trade is a ‘fashion’ trade, just as much as ladies’ hats, and if there is a desire for taper bonnets or pointed radiators, or any of the many <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> we have to fit, it is necessary to conform to that desire, or else the car is difficult to sell.” (140)  /   IN THE RETORT/CONVERSATION:  “The author cannot seriously suggest that the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> designed into the majority of cars, especially the high-priced types, are undesirable fads.  That would be an insult to the intelligence of their sponsors, who are presumably men who know their jobs both on the technical and financial side.  Any <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> embodied in a design are, rightly or wrongly, provided for a specific purpose and achieve some refinement which a competitor’s car does not possess.  I say rightly or wrongly, as they do not always fulfil [sic] expectation.” (143)  /  “I really cannot help wondering whether all the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> on those big, magnificent cars we aw at Olympia are really necessary, when I can get equal or greater comfort, smoothness and quietness without them.  IT is very nice, of course, to be able to sit back in a chair and adjust the petrol-feed of the carburettor to such a degree that the mixture can be gradually varied while under way.  It is beautiful for the man who wants to do it, but the very man who buys a GBP 2,000 car does not do it.”  (148)  /   “The man who can afford GBP2,000 for a chassis , who can afford all the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> in the world, and who sits in the car while his man does the rest, does not care how many <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> the car is fitted with, so long as he gets from his house to his office in time.”  (157)  /  “As a designer I object to exaggerated smoothness of design, and though at a Motor Show clean outline may look charming, I feel that external smoothness can be overdone.  The question of suiting the springing of a car to the load in the car has always been rather a fancy of mine, and although it is an extra <span class="red">gadget</span> I think it will shortly be fitted on a number of cars.  I do not say it is a good thing on every car, but there are plenty of people who will appreciate a device which will ensure equally good suspension, whether the car is light or loaded.  […]  As far as other <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> go, such as controllable carburettors, I must say I do feel that if the owner drives his car–and we are always being told that owners will drive, and not have chauffeurs–he will appreciate them.  A water circulation thermometer is a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>,’ but I find it very useful.”

  “The distortion of the ‘field section’ or ‘field sheet’ due to changes of humidity and temperature, has been a thorn in the side of the topographer for many years, neither does there appear to be any means of eliminating it as long as the field sheet is of paper, or Bristol board, mounted upon a wooden board.  […]  Indeed the feeling of many topographers is averse to the introduction of anything in the nature of a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>.’  In those countries where most of our plant table work is done breakdowns may be fatal.  Experiment has proved, however, that a simple but ingenious arrangement can be fitted to the existing pattern of legs which provides a slow motion, thrown in or out of action by a cam, and detachable at will.  It was tried in 1914 and unanimously approved of.”

  “As a born Cockney, living close to London every minute of my life, I had not noticed the slow change in the face and soul of London.  […]  The young men having gone to war, the streets were filled with middle-aged women of thirty, in short skirts, trying to attract the aged satyrs, the only men that remained, by pretending to be little girls.  […]  The common Cockney seemed to walk almost fearfully about his invaded streets, hardly daring to be himself or talk his own language.  apart from the foreign tongues, which always did annoy his ear, foul language now assailed him from every side:  ‘no bon,’ ‘napoo,’ ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>,’ ‘camouflaged,’ ‘buckshee,’ ‘bonza,’ and so on.  This is not good slang.  Good slang has a quality of its own–a bite and spit and fine expressiveness which do not belong to dictionary words.  That is its justification–the supplying of a lacking shade of expression, not the supplanting of adequate forms.  The old Cockney slang did justify itself, but this modern army rubbish, besides being uncouth, is utterly meaningless, and might have been invented by some idiot schoolboy:  probably was.”
