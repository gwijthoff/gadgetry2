  <strong>, 1930.</strong> “What do you think pleases my guests the most?’ Lewis asked.  After my tour of bewildering wonders I hesitated.  The engineer smiled and pointed to a shiny metal gadget on the wall.  ‘That little twenty-five-cent bottle opener and corkscrew, combined, makes more of a hit, if you’ll believe it, than some of our most ambitious engineering schemes.  They think it’s wonderful, and ask where they can buy one like it or whether they can have an extra one as a souvenir.  That’s human nature, I guess.  The average man, when he turns on a light or opens a radiator valve, doesn’t think of the power plant below that supplies him light and heat.  There’s far more to running a hotel than one ever sees in a guest room.’”

Take a look at the Mercurochrome Swab.  It’s a little glass tube with a brush on the end.  Break the tip inside the brush–out comes mercurochrome, an antiseptic.”

  <strong>MacDowell, Syl, 1930.</strong> “The Old Man was at dinner.  When about to work on a plate of salad, he jabbed his fork against something that clinked.  He growled and fished out a brass disk about the size of an English shilling.  He slammed the thing on the tablecloth and stare at it until his eyeballs almost popped out.  Then he roared:  ‘Boy!  Boy!’  Cato came on the lope from the pantry.  ‘What,’ demanded the Admiral, ‘is this gadget?’  Cato lenas over and spells out the words on the tag carefully.  He’s a Filipino, just getting educated.  ‘Hum,’ he finally said.  ‘Look lak a dog-license, yessa!”

  <strong>, 1930.</strong> “Can you get one and fit it to my car?  The circular says it’s a new invention that will give twice as much mileage on the same gasoline and make the motor more powerful.  …  I’ve seen this one before.  It’s a phoney gadget that doesn’t work.  …  Of course, they’d get better results by adjusting the carburetor for a leaner mixture without bothering with any extra gadget.”

With the exception of the pitch lap, a few chemicals used in silvering the glass, and other inexpensive gadgets, the whole array is of the kind that can be picked up around the average household and is typical of the kind used in telescope making.

  <strong>McHugh, F.D. et al., 1930.</strong> “In our July 1930 issue we described the very interesting experiments of Dr. Geer of Ithaca, whereby rubber, oil-impregnated airplane “overshoes” seem to have met the danger of ice formation.  It still remains to be seen whether practical aviators will resort to these overshoes.  Airmen have a horror of gadgets, and operators may fear that the added cost and a possible decrease in aerodynamic efficiency will be prohibitive.  In the meantime it is the consensus that it is a very sound plan to warn the pilot that he is flying in a danger zone, namely where temperatures are between -4 degrees and 0 degrees, centigrade, and when he had better proceed to a zone of higher or lower temperatures.”

  <strong>, 1930.</strong> “Now we’ll give it a real good cleaning out, he said as he carried the radiator over to the washstand and attached a special fixture to the lower hose connection.  What’s that gadget? Backson inquired.  Latest thing to clean radiators, Gus replied.  Water goes in the big pipe and the little one is connected to the air pressure line.  Shooting the air in with the water in short bursts fills the radiator with a churning mixture of water and bubbles that loostens the sludge and rust lots better than the ordinary flushing out.”

  <strong>Wilde, Perciva, 1931.</strong> “Slynes, Elkweather &amp; Uffley Gadgets.  It is attractively filled with gadgets (as well as widjums and whassats) in all colors.  Perhaps it is as well to mention that these are irregularly shaped objects varying in size from that of a marble to that of a small boulder.  Price tags are conspicuously attached to them as they await purchasers in the window.  They are much sought after for gifts by persons who wish to be considered original.”  (3)  On Mr. Uffley’s disease:  “What are leu- leucocytes?”  “Leucocytes?  A kind of gadget.  Nothing but gadgets!”  George Uffley takes pride in being able to draw gadgets, which his young son is working up to.  gadgets numbered “Number C 75, Number S 8080, Number M 44.”

If a botanist requires several complex solutions to stain certain fibbers, that is technique.  Another botanist’s suggestion that he would get the same result with a drop of marking ink is a wrinkle.”

  <strong>, 1931.</strong> “One thing is certain: manufacturers of automobile accessories are going to be affected by the general trend toward complete equipment on the newer cars. No longer need the new·car buyer invest a substantial sum in heat indicators, mirrors, ash trays, air cleaners, oiling systems, and so on.They are all there when the car is delivered.On the other hand, those of us who have, of necessity or choice, to keep our old cars for another season, constitute a potential market for “gadgets” of various kinds that have been developed since our cars were made.”

  <strong>, 1931.</strong> “There is no question but that the American working man is our biggest customer. He knows that his net income is very much higher under the high wage system than under the other; his percentage of “luxury” or “pleasure” cash is much greater under the former than under the latter. He has, accordingly adjusted his standard of living to a scale higher than Europeans know or have known.  He has a car with all the necessary or foolish gadgets, a six- or eight- or ten-tube radio, good clothes, plenty of good food, and more comforts than a medieval king.”

He has also constructed a dingbat for making the knife-edge test. This, he admits, is against the rules of the game (ATM page 97) but says he made it, anyway, just for fun.”

  <strong>, 1932.</strong> “The answer is a multiple one : The use of rear flaps changes the trim or balance, and therefore stability has to be carefully considered when flaps or variable-area wings are used; human nature is conservative pilots dislike intensely everything that partakes of the character of a “gadget”; cost and weight are always in­ creased no matter what slot or flap is applied.”

  ** Leyson, Captain Burr, 1933.** “He realized that they were without his beloved ‘gadgets’ and dependent upon the skill of the pilot alone.  And he was one of the newer school, one of these youngsters ‘softened’ by all the mechanical aids developed to lift the burden from their shoulders!”  …  young pilot decides to fly through:  “He was flying blind, solely by his instruments.  All of the gadgets which Pop had lavished upon the ships with the idea of making up for the deficiencies of the pilots were useless.”  …  “The gadget I’ve missed, forgotten, clean overlooked in my calculations is the cool head of the pilot, my boy!  That’s what it is!  I’ve been thinking the breed had changed, softened up from the old days.  Well, they have changed at that!  They have grown better!  Shake hands, pilot!”

  <strong>Galbraith, Robert Earle ed., 1933.</strong> “The modern American prose in this volume has as its distinguishing mark a certain tone.  This tone is a compound of freshness, vigor, sprightliness, and a kind of good-natured sophistication.  Its style is easy, almost nonchalant; but under its smooth surface lies genuine techncial competence and sound writing craftsmanship.  /  The increasing popularity of this kind of writing is a tribute to its extraordinary effectivenes.  Whether used for a narrative summary of a news event, or for the intricate analysis of a biographical study, its charm attracts and holds the reader.  If we may predict, a command of its technique will become more an more necessary for the student who aspires to the pages of our better magazines or even to the columns of his college publications.”  …  Elsie Gregory Macgill, “What to Call an Airplane”:  “There are flying field terms galore for the airplane’s structural parts.  Gadget is the panacea of all errors.  You can never go wrong with gadget, as it covers everything from the wings to the pilot’s toothbrush.  Other terms are more specific.” (37)  …  section:  PROCESSES, DEVICES, MECHANISMS.  Morris Markey, “The Prophets”:  New Yorker interview with a meteorologist.  “We began with the barometer, because that was just beside his desk.  Rather, let us say, five of them were beside his desk.  They were no fancy optical-shop gadgets with enamelled dials and brass needles.  They were simple tubes of mercury, two or three feet high, with scales affixed to them after the manner of a thermometer.” (74)  …  section: CRITICISM.  George F.T. Ryall.  “The Plymouth’s Floating Power”:  “The car has free-wheeling, too, which may be turned on or off by a pull-gadget, under the dash, that looks like a large choke button” (89).  …  section:  THE SHORT STORY.  John Chapin Mosher.  “Storm at Sea”:  “Everybody but himself was asleep on that boat, and the water was pouring in, quite soaking the sheets now. […] He slipped out of bed and stood in his bare feet.  It was a fancy little gadget holding up the window.  He couldn’t do anything with it and a gust of rain blew in and sopped his pajamas.”

The material is low­ priced mineral in the rough–moss agates, rose quartz, carnelian, jasper, chalcedony, tiger eye and so on–obtainable from mineral dealers, or often is most unpromising stones simply picked up while on country rocks.”

<p><strong>, 1934.</strong> “Not a ‘Gadget’:  REO self-shifter.  As vital as self-starter; a safer, simpler means of driving.  The lure of many strange devices has been held out to automobile buyers in the last few years.  Gadget after gadget has taken its place in the parade of expedients.  It is therefore understandable why some buyers have been confused–have found it difficult to distinguish between a gadget and a genuine improvement.  Yet there is a simple way of telling.  Try any device you have in mind and see how much actual difference it makes in the operation of a car.  Then take the wheel of the Self-Shifting Reo.  HERE is something FUNDAMENTAL!  No gearshift lever – gearshifting automatic – innumerable cluth operations saved – driving made 33 1/3% easier and SAFER!”

The results of this research called for a warning against such purchases, which the Bureau issued.”  /  All of the ‘gas savers,’ it stated, affected the operation of a satisfactory gas range in such a way as to increase the tendency to form carbon monoxide, which even in very small amounts is injurious to health.  Although agents sometimes boasted of a reduction in gas bills as high as 30 percent, none of the attachments tested increased efficiency appreciably, while some of them considerably increased the amount of gas need for certain purposes.”

Gadgets are–well, here I’ll show you one.’  /  Wood walked over to a twelve cylinder car.  He removed from the dashboard an attractive, nickeled object that was about three inches long.  /  ‘It’s an automatic cigaret lighter,’ he explained, ‘it lights and breathes, inhaling and exhaling, just as you do.  All you do is put your cigaret in it, press a button and your cigaret is lighted and puffed on until you take it out.  Saves you taking your eyes off the road while driving eight or ninety miles an hour.  It’s just a gadget but I think I’ll have it patented.’  /  But the Miss America [ship], were there not a lot of gadgets on her?  Didn’t gadgets play a large part in the final perfection attained in the assembly of four motors having a total of 6,400 horsepower?  /  ‘Not on your life,’ Gar replied emphatically.  ‘The Miss America X is the result of long research, of many painstaking laboratory experiments and of repeated practical tests.  /  ‘I am not denying that there are gadgets here and there that fulfil [sic] their purposes, I would even call the self-bailers on the boat a ‘gadget idea’–but the principal reasons for Miss America X’s success lie in the gear-box assembly and the boat’s variable step.”  On the next boat Wood is developing:  “‘But before we race it we’ll have to do a lot of work on blueprints, hold a whole lot of laboratory tests and do plenty of practical experimenting.

  <strong>Harding, T. Swann, 1934.</strong> “[The Food and Drugs Act] defines a drug as an agent used in the treatment of disease. Freckles, excess hair, wrinkles, enlarged pores, falling hair, obesity, and dandruff are not dis­ eases; they may be blemishes or botherations, but they no more classify as diseases than do irregularly architectures noses and shortness of stature. Hence cosmetics are not drugs, unless they make some specific claim to cute disease on their labels-which, generally speaking, they never do.  Cosmetics are surely not foods.  Gadgets to straighten noses are not drugs, and neither are mechanical chiropractors intended to stretch the short men to great height so that they may avoid the failures and humiliations those of small stature (like Napoleon) undergo.  /  Therefore the present Food and Drugs Act does not cover cosmetics. It does not cover therapeutic gadgets and contraptions, some of them selling for 10 dollars and costing 75 cents to make, and all of them as astonishingly magical in their claimed powers as the miraculous necklace some firm got out to cure goiter.  […]  In . consequence of these deficiencies which have made Dr. Harvey W. Wiley’s Food and Drugs Act obsolete, a revision of that act has been prepared to supersede the old statute. It was written by legal and scientific experts in the Department of Agriculture, gained the blessing of the Administration, and was introduced in the Senate by Senator Copeland in June 1933 as S. 1944.  That bill does specifically cover cosmetics. It covers gadgets and contrivances. It covers advertising, applying the same standard of accuracy to it that the present law applies to food and drug labels. It sets up food standards and it establishes minimum tolerances for the poison con­ tent of foods.”

When these deflectors were turned into the wind, it was found by scientific wind tunnel test that the velocity of the wind outside the cockpit but in the lee of the deflector was reduced to negligible pro­ portions. Therefore the pilot could look out at the side of the cockpit without discomfort.  In another type the windshield is divided into two parts, and so arranged that the upper part can be staggered ahead of the lower part. Wind tunnel tests showed here that the air was deflected upwards with­ out any perceptible draught being felt in the cockpit, yet vision through the open­ ing was perfect. While open cockpits are now rarer than was the case a few years ago, anyone flying in an open ship might do worse than to ‘use one or the other of these two gadgets.”

A variation of this, where a low viewpoint is desired, is to point this finder straight down to the floor or sidewalk and become ostensibly immersed in the examination of some mechanical problem of the camera itself.”

  <strong>, 1936.</strong> “The question is frequently asked whether it is not cheaper to buy one’s photographic accessories than  to build them.  Such a statement cannot be answered with a blanket reply of ‘yes’ or ‘no’ because several factors are involved.  What, for instance, is meant by expense?  Money or time?  From the dollars and cents viewpoint, it may be cheaper to ‘make it yourself’ but it will, of course, involve time–in some cases, a great deal of time.  It is taken for granted, of course, that the home-made article will be made so well that it will work as effectively as the purchased one.  /  Another point to consider is the ‘makeup’ of the builder himself.  There are some self-sufficient people, sometimes known as the ‘handy-man’ type, who will never buy an article that they can possibly make themselves.  With such persons, the expense of time will be offset by the satisfaction derived from making the desired gadget.  /  Then there is the factor of whether the accessory in question is available on the market.  Certain photographic problems are so peculiar and unusual that nothing remains for the worker to do but to make the required tool himself or to go without it.”

A kitchen rack arose, with hooks for pots and pans and space for plates and eating utensils.  A ‘cup tree’ spread out its arms.  Over in that corner (I am pointing SW now) we dug an underground refrigerator.  And in the other direction was the covered garbage hole and the grease trap, which consisted of a small pit with a wicker cover.  On the cover we piled a couple of handfulls of dry grass to absorb the grease from the messy water poured through it.  The grass we renewed daily, burning the old lot.

Almost all of them, in a word, were gadgets.  /  A gadget is not easy to define.  It is a kind of what’s or thingumabob or dingus–all these excellent slang words being themselves, alas, rather nebulous and indefinable.  The fact that it is indefinable may be, I suspect, the clue to the gadget’s nature.  The gadget, in short, is a gadget; which is to say that it is not definable in terms of its relation to the real life and basic pursuits of man.  A ‘hat’ we may define; it is an object to keep the human head warm or dry or shaded or otherwise comfortable.  We may readily enough define food or drink or books or houses.  But the gadget…” (590)  * * * “I hear complaints and repinings now and again that in this age philosophy is dead.  But I do not think so.  There has simply been substituted, for other philosophies, the philosophy of the gadget.  This philosophy is but materialism carried to a somewhat attenuated but entirely logical extreme.  It is the ultimate, and rather pathetic, expression of acquisitiveness.  […]  We have deified gadgets, precisely as we have tended more and more to make material concerns for ultimates of our thinking.  For that modern temper which delights ‘to pay devout and uncritical obeisance to the analytic intelligence,’ disclaiming every other human faculty of apprehension, and which–being beset by economic woes–is obsessed by economic criteria of values, and by those alone, it would be hard to find a more fitting symbol and insignia than The Gadget.”  “That we seek to appease this gnawing sense of want and incompleteness by devising newer and queerer and more elaborate gadgets is not more ridiculous than sad.  It is part of the flight from reality, or rather, perhaps, of the refusal to face reality steadfastly and with full realization.”  Goes to a “dream of some day about the year 5000” when archaeologists explore “the subterranean ruins of a great twentieth-century city,” uncovering miserable tabloids chronicling war, “night clubs,” and the horrors of… ::gasp:: stand up comedy!  “And then, in this dream, I see the leader of the archaeological party pounce with delight upon a small object in the dust, and I hear him cry ‘Here is their sacred talisman, the symbol of their religion!’ and I see him hold up to his conferères a cigar-lighter with the recipes for eight cocktails printed on it, and with a fountain-pen at one end of it and a flashlight at the other.”

  <strong>Newton, Joseph Fort, 1937.</strong> “I have found Americans out,’ writes a dear English friend, who is a good deal of a wag.  ‘They are gadget-minded.  If they see a thing that needs to be done, they rig up a device, mechanical or mental, and make the thing do itself with no further bother.’  /  ‘As a result,’ he goes on,’ they have created a touch-the-button civilization, and I for one admire it.  Why go on doing a thing in the same old way, over and over again, if we can make a robot do it for us, and do it better?  My hat is of to the gadget mind.’  /  To prove his point he refers to the Mark Twain story of the Connecticut Yankee at the Court of King Arthur.  The Yankee saw a saint swaying to and fro in an ecstasy of devotion, and to him it was a clear case of lost motion.  So he sat about and invented a device by which to harness the saint and use his motions to run a sewing machine.  In other words, he put religion to a practical use.  /  But, my friend goes on to say, there are some fields in which the gadget mind will not work; and here he gets under our skin a bit.  We tried to achieve temperance by prohibition, and it failed.  We passed the law, wrote it into the Constitution and thought that the thing was done, and would stay done, or else would go on doing itself.  /  In the same way, he adds–rubbing it in rather sharply–we proposed the Pact of Paris; just another glorious gadget.  We wrote a law outlawing war, renouncing it as a policy of nations.  The Law was solemnly signed; an dew thought the thing was done once for all.  But, alas, we see now that much remains to be done before war is ended.  /  In other words, my friend argues rightly, something more than a gadget mind is needed to deal with the issues now before mankind.  It cannot be done by a twist of the wrist or the turn of a trick, much less by touching a button.  We need vision, and the courage, wisdom and patience to work it out, though it may take a long time.  /  Yes, the gadget mind is useful in its place; it can do many things.  But the spiritual mind, God-illumined, is the hope of the race.”

  <strong>Fraprie, Frank R. and Franklin I. Jordan, 1937.</strong> “This book is the work of many authors.  No one person could ever think up half the things it contains.  It came out of the sweat and toil and practical experience of hundreds of enthusiastic photographers whose nimble wits have devised thse clever mechanical means for overcoming some of their many difficulties that stand between them and the attainment of their goal.  …  Photography is a many-sided hobby.  Among other diversions, it provides those of its devotees who like to tinker with tools a never ending incentive to make devices for which they have immediate and very practical use.  They ahve the fun of making things whose utility amply justifies the time and inexpensive materials required.  …  It is not the purpose of most of these ingenious gadgets to take trade away from the photographic manufacturer.  Commercial products cannot usually be duplicated in the home workshop at anything like the cost of the manufactured article.  But here are many items not regularly marketed.  They would probably not have sufficient sale to warrant their manufacture, although many of them will prove invaluable to workers faced with problems similar to those of the writers.  We are confident that no one seriously engaged in photography, especially under makeshift conditions in the home where so much enthusiastic work is done, can fail to find in this book many hints which will save him not only an appreciable amount of time and money, but also much vexation of spirit.”

  <strong>Calahan, Harold Augustin, 1938.</strong> “But if a gadget is a machine, an invention, a mechanical means of achieving a result, a wrinkle is a method of procedure.  Again our lexicographer, rating the word as colloquial, one step higher than slang, describes it as ‘a curious or ingenious notion; happy thought.’  I will accept that phrase ‘happy thought’ as particularly pat.  But to the seaman, a gadget is a thing, and a wrinkle is a method, and both of them for most part unusual and unstandardized.” (viii))  /  That a gadget is a solution that arises naturally out of the materials of the ship – similar to distinction made in US Court of Appeals case on the difference between a gadget and an invention:  “In the long centuries in which men have sailed the seas, they have faced and solved oft-recurring problems.  When these problems present themselves on every passage and on every tack, the means of solving them are built right into the ship or her rigging.  ut when, as so often occurs, the problem arises out of some unusual situation, the sailor is forced to turn inventor.  He calls upon all his ingenuity.  He summons to his aid his past experience with the solution of some similar problem.  And perhaps he remembers, with that strange race memory which is often mis-called instinct, some similar experience of a sea-going ancestor.”  /  “Our lexicographers define a gadget as ‘anything the name of which cannot be recalled at the moment,’ and in parentheses, they add (Slang, U.S. Navy.)  But the name has a broader meaning and a riper antiquity than the dictionary credits.  I believe the term is older than the navy itself, ad far too deeply imbedded in the language to merit the transitory stigma of slang.  A landsman’s synonyms for gadget are thing-um-bob, widget, what-do-yer-call-it, do-funny.  A sailor’s synonym is gilhickey, although a purist would make a distinction by never using the term gilhickey except to distinguish one gadget from another.  The first gadget is the gadget.  The second gadget in any situation in which two appear is the gilhickey.”  (viii)  /  The temporality/longevity/life-span of a gadget–“But it must not be considered that the term is applied merely as a temporary substitute for an object’s true name.  Most of the unusual things about a ship go nameless forever.  When an invention becomes so standardized that it acquires a name, it ceases to be a gadget except for those brief periods when its distinguishing name is forgotten.  But there are thousands of unusual things about a ship or a yacht that were born gadgets and will remain gadgets as long as they are used.  They are the inventions that solve the rare problems, the machines that are unnecessary on most vessels and at most times and are therefore nameless.” That at any moment, a gadget could become a wrinkle and vice versa–the difference between a tool and a procedure is not readily identifiable:  “I have been sore put to it to organize this book.  For I am dealing with concepts that have thus far resisted organization so well that they have avoided being tagged with names.  Also it is pretty hard to tell where a gadget begins and a wrinkle ends or vice versa.  Take a familiar example.  You are about to tie two lines together.  You tie them into a weaver’s knot.  Standard practice so far–no gadgets, no wrinkles.  The nrealizing that ther eis going to be a terrific strain on that line and that the knot will be pulled so tight that you will never be able to untie it again, you decide to slip a toggle into the knot.  That’s a happy thought, for you can always take a hammer and drive out the toggle and the knot will be loose.  What is that toggle–a winkle or a gadget?  Now suppose we decide that the strain is going to be so great that it will be difficult to drive out an ordinary toggle.  So we use a large fid whose sloping shape assures us that the slightest driving with the hammer will loosen the knot.  Is the wrinkle now a gadget?  Or if the small end of the fid is greased to make it slip more easily through the the tight turns of the knot, does it become a wrinkle again?  I don’t know and I don’t pretend to try to find out.  The line of demarkation is too indistinct.  So I shall write about gadgets and wrinkles without worrying much about branding them with their proper names.”

  ** Nock, Albert Jay, 1939.** “Similarly a romancer who had a cynical turn might foreshadow the collapse of Wester civilization, and call it The Triumph of the Gadget.  In all probability the emergence of the gadget has had a vast deal to do with the degenerative process.  During the last fifty years there has been invented almost every conceivable labor-saving device, with the consequence that the average man is in a state of utter manual incompetence.  This is well-known and is often commented upon.  But what is not so often observed in that these gadgets are not only labor-saving but brain-saving, thought-saving; and it seems an inescapable conclusion that a correlative mental incompetence is being induced.  /  A certain amount of resistance seems necessary for the proper functioning of mental and moral attributes, as it is for that of physical attributes.  In any of these three departments of life, if you can get results without effort, and habitually do so, the capacity for making the effort dwindles.  Whatever takes away the opportunity for effort, whatever obviates or reduces the need for making it, is therefore to some degree deleterious.  It needs a bit of brains to manage a furnace-fire successfully; an automatic heater needs none; hence many householders today could not manage a furnace-fire to save their lives”

  <strong>Lengyel, Emil, 1936.</strong> “Rumor said that Mussolini might visit Avigliani, and an old fogy in the tavern on Piedmont Lane swore that he had seen him in the village, his heavy chin covered with a dense growth of beard so as to escape recognition. Giovanni followed the call of higher wages and set out for Torino, promising his mother an easier life. The automobile factory hired him, and he served the machine all day, adjusting to the cars a gadget which looked like a pair of skates. At first he thought his back would break in two. Once or twice he collapsed with fatigue and the foreman swore at him in the choice dialect of Calabria, which he did not understand. But after a few weeks Giovanni became used to his servitude and even began to find comfort in the quiet irresponsibility of his work. He earned far more than he could have made in his native village, and part of his money went to his mother.”

  <strong>, 1937.</strong> “Tired of lacing up his boots, a Chicagoan named W. L, Judson in 1893 devised the world’s first slide fastener. It worked badly, but it made an instantaneous impression upon Colonel Lewis Walker, a lawyer from Meadville, Pa. Colonel Walker spent the next 20 years and about $1,000,000 collected from a multitude of sources, before he began to achieve any commercial success with the gadget. Judson was unable to perfect it and it was not until 1913 that one Gideon Sundback developed the “ zipper “ as everyone now knows it. Started that year in a $300-a-year shack in Meadville, Hookless Fastener Co., maker of “ Talon “ fasteners, immediately went to town, is now the biggest of 16-odd U. S. zipper makers.”

  <strong>Furnas, J.C., 1937.</strong> “When the President pushes an ivory button on his desk to open the sluices of Hoover Dam or light up the symbolic Tower of Something or Other at a world’s fair, reporters, newsreel cameras and microphones are always there to trumpet abroad the drama of the occasion. When John Smith registers at a metropolitan hotel in the modern tradition, that is another simple act which sets in motion a machine as impressive as any 10,000-ton gadget in a powerhouse. But this huge, part-human, part-mechanical organization is out of sight and silent, all the more so the better it works. If he realized the amount of smoothly oiled routine called for by the mere fact of his arrival, John Smith might get a swelled head. Which would be unfortunate, because, as the above parable indicates, this machine has a double function: It is tooled and synchronized to supply the guest whatever he wants with so much speed and so little inconvenience”

The so-called bottlenecks of industrial production are looming large in Germany, England, even the United States, and professional economists everywhere are coming to insist that you may have large unemployment along with a serious shortage of skilled labor? indeed, paradoxically enough, the labor shortage may to a considerable extent be responsible for unemployment. The failure of one highly specialized factory manufacturing a particular gadget may hold up a great deal of industrial production which depends directly or indirectly upon that particular gadget. All that the November decrees did was to charge the Axe Committee with studying these bottlenecks and devising plans for a more effective distribution of labor.”

Now produced by automatic machinery, these cards are still expensive. Inasmuch as a separate card is needed for each thread of weft, a mere 10-inch design may require 800 cards which cost a little more than $100.00 to make. Not so with the Lefler robot. The cost has plummeted to $5.00. With this surprisingly simple gadget, the most intricate designs may be faithfully duplicated. Merely writing one’s name on a copper plate is sufficient to initiate an action that eventuates in the appearance of // that name woven into cloth with every shade and inflection perfectly preserved. A delicate electric finger plays over the inked copper master and delivers an electronically-amplified current to a series of small electromagnets each of which controls a needle of the loom.”

For this development of the purely mechanical part of film production in Hollywood has become one of the major miracles of history. If only some of the other departments had kept pace with this development . . . but there is no point in indulging in depressing and fruitless speculation. [. . . ] There has been much talk lately of the dreadful mechanical Robot that is ruining Art in our modern civilization. Our finer aesthetic sensibilities, we are told, are being mangled in the ruthless cog-wheels of the Machine Age. / Insofar as Hollywood is concerned, however, it is the Robot, the Spirit of the Gadget, that most nearly approaches that goal of perfection toward which all art strives. / How often do we see pictures in which the technical qualities—the photography, sound reproduction, mechanical effects—are inferior to the flesh, the blood and the grey matter? Almost never. For an excellent example of just what I mean, have a look at ‘Hell’s Angels.’”

Robert Taylor’s cuff links are weensy-weensy watches too small to tell the time except with a magnifying glass. Hugh Herbert has a time clock arrangement that dims the light when it’s time for him to stop reading in bed. Chester Morris’s electric toothbrush is the smartest gadget in town these days.”

  <strong>Stull, William, 1937.</strong> “In one of Teorey’s shoregoing films he used quick whirls of the camera for rapid transitions. When asked how he did that he brought out a most amazing gadget and confessed it cost him exactly nothing. But it does the trick! Two strips of wood, joined in L shape, carry the camera, which is held in place by an ordinary wing bolt screwing into the tripod socket. Attached to the upright of the L, and in line with the axis of the lens, is a length of metal rod.”

  <strong>Maas, Carl, 1938.</strong> “Electricity has so recently revolutionized lighting that everyone is now conscious of the problems involved in balancing correct light with attractive lighting. Although much of the recent talk about correct lighting is simply propaganda for gadgetry, the new interest in light makes it easier to investigate? and to solve? the difficulty of combining beauty and use in artificial light.”
