  “What do you think pleases my guests the most?’ Lewis asked.  After my tour of bewildering wonders I hesitated.  The engineer smiled and pointed to a shiny metal <span class="red">gadget</span> on the wall.  ‘That little twenty-five-cent bottle opener and corkscrew, combined, makes more of a hit, if you’ll believe it, than some of our most ambitious engineering schemes.  They think it’s wonderful, and ask where they can buy one like it or whether they can have an extra one as a souvenir.  That’s human nature, I guess.  The average man, when he turns on a light or opens a radiator valve, doesn’t think of the power plant below that supplies him light and heat.  There’s far more to running a hotel than one ever sees in a guest room.’”

The Vivo Tube, for fainting and insect bites, isn’t the only ‘glass <span class="red">gadget</span>’ in the Official First Aid Kit.  Take a look at the Mercurochrome Swab.

  “The Old Man was at dinner.  When about to work on a plate of salad, he jabbed his fork against something that clinked.  He growled and fished out a brass disk about the size of an English shilling.  He slammed the thing on the tablecloth and stare at it until his eyeballs almost popped out.  Then he roared:  ‘Boy!  Boy!’  Cato came on the lope from the pantry.  ‘What,’ demanded the Admiral, ‘is this <span class="red">gadget</span>?’  Cato lenas over and spells out the words on the tag carefully.

With the exception of the pitch lap, a few chemicals used in silvering the glass, and other inexpensive <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, the whole array is of the kind that can be picked up around the average household and is typical of the kind used in telescope making.

  “In our July 1930 issue we described the very interesting experiments of Dr. Geer of Ithaca, whereby rubber, oil-impregnated airplane “overshoes” seem to have met the danger of ice formation.  It still remains to be seen whether practical aviators will resort to these overshoes.  Airmen have a horror of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, and operators may fear that the added cost and a possible decrease in aerodynamic efficiency will be prohibitive.  In the meantime it is the consensus that it is a very sound plan to warn the pilot that he is flying in a danger zone, namely where temperatures are between -4 degrees and 0 degrees, centigrade, and when he had better proceed to a zone of higher or lower temperatures.”

What’s that <span class="red">gadget</span>? Backson inquired.  Latest thing to clean radiators, Gus replied.  Water goes in the big pipe and the little one is connected to the air pressure line.  Shooting the air in with the water in short bursts fills the radiator with a churning mixture of water and bubbles that loostens the sludge and rust lots better than the ordinary flushing out.”

  “have food that the skipper will cat without a growl, or else you gain the cook’s tolerance by letting him boil rice and open a tin of beef for dinner, and hear the skipper cursing all cooks and mates to Gehenna. Besides this, you have to navigate, which breaks up your morning watches below; and you have to sailorize when you should be pacing the deck, admiring the billowy ocean, and enjoying yourself as a chief officer should!’ Feeling much better after this, I gave the flywheel another turn, flipped the spark-plug <span class="red">gadget</span> with my index finger, and to my surprise and consternation the thing started off with a terrible explosion of backfiring. With my heart in my mouth I jumped to the switch and turned it off.

  “In the course of a post mortem on the late and generally lamented international yacht races, a London newspaper remarked that ‘British seamanship was defeated by Yankee <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.’ This referred, of course, to the fact that the ‘Enterprise’ used various mechanical labor-saving devices for the speedy raising and lower of sails, whereas the ‘Shamrock’ relied exclusively on old-fashioned elbow grease. / Hollywood’s position of leadership in the celluloid world is invariably attributed to the superiority of ‘Yankee <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>’—the sound recording apparatus behind the greatest <span class="red">gadget</span> of all. / There is plenty of truth in this. For this development of the purely mechanical part of film production in Hollywood has become one of the major miracles of history. If only some of the other departments had kept pace with this development . . . but there is no point in indulging in depressing and fruitless speculation. [. . . ] There has been much talk lately of the dreadful mechanical Robot that is ruining Art in our modern civilization. Our finer aesthetic sensibilities, we are told, are being mangled in the ruthless cog-wheels of the Machine Age. / Insofar as Hollywood is concerned, however, it is the Robot, the Spirit of the <span class="red">Gadget</span>, that most nearly approaches that goal of perfection toward which all art strives. / How often do we see pictures in which the technical qualities—the photography, sound reproduction, mechanical effects—are inferior to the flesh, the blood and the grey matter? Almost never. For an excellent example of just what I mean, have a look at ‘Hell’s Angels.’”

It is a combination focus chart and scene slate. On one side is the chart, on the other the slate. The entire <span class="red">gadget</span> is of a heavy quality fabrakoid.

  “A couple of weeks later he aroused the curiosity, and the ire, of the engineer in charge of the power house when he started installing a peculiar looking <span class="red">gadget</span> in the base of the huge chimney. It consisted of a selenium cell on one side of the chimney, and an electric bulb on the other. And when the next rain fell the young Cal Tech man did not have to go out and get wet, for the smoke would cut off the light and thus operate the galvanometer hooked to the cell, ringing a bell when the smoke would appear.

Perhaps modern invention has made the pioneer delight of eating popcorn seem an anachronism. At any rate, there is not the old joy in corn popped in a little electrical <span class="red">gadget</span> that there used to be in the delicious stuff that was energetically shaken in a frying pan over a redhot stove. A German techni cian sees a city as Breathing a great organism of a constantly inhaling Metropolis. and exhaling vast breaths up and down in the atmosphere. In Berlin, he estimates, the breathing of human beings and animals and the exhausts of automobiles and chimneys produces at least 20,000 tons of carbon dioxide a day. Trees and other living plants absorb only a small fraction of the gas”

  “An ingenious contraption called a “Thrill- O-Meter” was used for advance publicity on “Rue Morgue” by C. E. O’Donnell, manager of the Paramount Theatre, Baton Rouge, La. This thrill-o-meter was constructed by- building a lobby cut-out and using the figure of a gorilla. The display was arranged so that its base covered the lobby scales. Then under the scales platform, a water bag was placed, filled with colored liquid. The hot water bag was attached to a glass indicator tube which ran up the center of the cut-out. At various levels on the indicator, small cards were placed with copy such as : 200-220. .. .You like to be thrilled! 160-180. .. .We advise you to be accom- panied by an escort! 120-140 Its thrills will chill you! Wear an overcoat ! 80-100. . . .You have an average heart and can stand the supreme thrills in “Murders in the Rue Morgue !” 40- 60…. Don’t enter unless accompanied by a friend ! - 20. . . .You’re too young to see this pic- ture without your parents ! We believe the above description will en- able the average person to construct a simi- lar <span class="red">gadget</span>, if the spirit so prompts him, and we are indebted to O’Donnell for passing along the information.”

  “The modern American prose in this volume has as its distinguishing mark a certain tone.  This tone is a compound of freshness, vigor, sprightliness, and a kind of good-natured sophistication.  Its style is easy, almost nonchalant; but under its smooth surface lies genuine techncial competence and sound writing craftsmanship.  /  The increasing popularity of this kind of writing is a tribute to its extraordinary effectivenes.  Whether used for a narrative summary of a news event, or for the intricate analysis of a biographical study, its charm attracts and holds the reader.  If we may predict, a command of its technique will become more an more necessary for the student who aspires to the pages of our better magazines or even to the columns of his college publications.”  …  Elsie Gregory Macgill, “What to Call an Airplane”:  “There are flying field terms galore for the airplane’s structural parts.  <span class="red">Gadget</span> is the panacea of all errors.

  “[The Food and Drugs Act] defines a drug as an agent used in the treatment of disease. Freckles, excess hair, wrinkles, enlarged pores, falling hair, obesity, and dandruff are not dis­ eases; they may be blemishes or botherations, but they no more classify as diseases than do irregularly architectures noses and shortness of stature. Hence cosmetics are not drugs, unless they make some specific claim to cute disease on their labels-which, generally speaking, they never do.  Cosmetics are surely not foods.  <span class="red">Gadget</span>s to straighten noses are not drugs, and neither are mechanical chiropractors intended to stretch the short men to great height so that they may avoid the failures and humiliations those of small stature (like Napoleon) undergo.  /  Therefore the present Food and Drugs Act does not cover cosmetics.

There is the angle view finder, by means of which the photographer may take pictures unsuspected by the subject; the reflex attachment for converting the Leica or Contax type camera into a reflex camera, thus combining two types of camera in one; the panorama tripod head which permits the miniature camera to do the work of a regular panorama camera; apparatus for converting the cameras into a stereoscopic camera; attachments for photo­ micrography; flash lamps accommodating flash bulbs which may be attached to the camera and made to operate simultaneously with the release of the shutter so that flash and shutter act together; single-exposure attachment with focusing device for close-ups of 10 inches; copying attachments, and many other devices allowing the owner of the miniature camera unlimited scope in his camera adventures, including even col­or photography.”

  “In one type, deflectors, consisting of small airfoils, are placed at the side of the wind­ shield and slightly ahead of the screen proper. When these deflectors were turned into the wind, it was found by scientific wind tunnel test that the velocity of the wind outside the cockpit but in the lee of the deflector was reduced to negligible pro­ portions. Therefore the pilot could look out at the side of the cockpit without discomfort.  In another type the windshield is divided into two parts, and so arranged that the upper part can be staggered ahead of the lower part. Wind tunnel tests showed here that the air was deflected upwards with­ out any perceptible draught being felt in the cockpit, yet vision through the open­ ing was perfect. While open cockpits are now rarer than was the case a few years ago, anyone flying in an open ship might do worse than to ‘use one or the other of these two <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.”

  “The true candid camera man is the most self-effacing chap on earth; the more he is ignored, the less he is observed, the better he likes it. Among the array of miniature cameras, accessories and wonder·working films and developing solutions that produce prints which would have been impossible only a few years ago, he wants for but one thing––some magic formula by which he might make himself invisible at will.  /  Lacking such a formula, however, the exigencies of his ‘now-you-see-me-now-you-don’t’ career have taught him many subterfuges, in which he is ably abetted by a number of ‘<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.’  One of the most useful of these is the so-called angle·view finder, a device which by means of mirrors enables the photographer to give the impression of aiming at something down the street while actually taking the picture of a subject standing at right angles to the photographer’s apparent vision.  A variation of this, where a low viewpoint is desired, is to point this finder straight down to the floor or sidewalk and become ostensibly immersed in the examination of some mechanical problem of the camera itself.”

  “Therefore, I reasoned, no normal person can lie without increasing his blood pressure. This reasoning proved sound. Every time a subject lied, his systolic blood pressure went up. The more important the lie, the greater the mental effort and the greater the rise in blood pressure. I published the systolic blood pressure test for deception in rgy. Immediately the newspapers dubbed it the “ Lie Detector “ and referred to it as a mysterious apparatus. Actually the Lie Detector uses standard types of the sphygmomanometer - that little <span class="red">gadget</span> which doctors wrap around your arm just above the elbow to take your blood pressure - to reveal the added mental effort used in lying.”

  “The question is frequently asked whether it is not cheaper to buy one’s photographic accessories than  to build them.  Such a statement cannot be answered with a blanket reply of ‘yes’ or ‘no’ because several factors are involved.  What, for instance, is meant by expense?  Money or time?  From the dollars and cents viewpoint, it may be cheaper to ‘make it yourself’ but it will, of course, involve time–in some cases, a great deal of time.  It is taken for granted, of course, that the home-made article will be made so well that it will work as effectively as the purchased one.  /  Another point to consider is the ‘makeup’ of the builder himself.  There are some self-sufficient people, sometimes known as the ‘handy-man’ type, who will never buy an article that they can possibly make themselves.  With such persons, the expense of time will be offset by the satisfaction derived from making the desired <span class="red">gadget</span>.  /  Then there is the factor of whether the accessory in question is available on the market.

Almost all of them, in a word, were <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  /  A <span class="red">gadget</span> is not easy to define.  It is a kind of what’s or thingumabob or dingus–all these excellent slang words being themselves, alas, rather nebulous and indefinable.  The fact that it is indefinable may be, I suspect, the clue to the <span class="red">gadget</span>’s nature.  The <span class="red">gadget</span>, in short, is a <span class="red">gadget</span>; which is to say that it is not definable in terms of its relation to the real life and basic pursuits of man.  A ‘hat’ we may define; it is an object to keep the human head warm or dry or shaded or otherwise comfortable.  We may readily enough define food or drink or books or houses.  But the <span class="red">gadget</span>…” (590) / “I hear complaints and repinings now and again that in this age philosophy is dead.  But I do not think so.  There has simply been substituted, for other philosophies, the philosophy of the <span class="red">gadget</span>.  This philosophy is but materialism carried to a somewhat attenuated but entirely logical extreme.  It is the ultimate, and rather pathetic, expression of acquisitiveness.  […]  We have deified <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, precisely as we have tended more and more to make material concerns for ultimates of our thinking.  For that modern temper which delights ‘to pay devout and uncritical obeisance to the analytic intelligence,’ disclaiming every other human faculty of apprehension, and which–being beset by economic woes–is obsessed by economic criteria of values, and by those alone, it would be hard to find a more fitting symbol and insignia than The <span class="red">Gadget</span>.”  “That we seek to appease this gnawing sense of want and incompleteness by devising newer and queerer and more elaborate <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is not more ridiculous than sad.  It is part of the flight from reality, or rather, perhaps, of the refusal to face reality steadfastly and with full realization.”  Goes to a “dream of some day about the year 5000” when archaeologists explore “the subterranean ruins of a great twentieth-century city,” uncovering miserable tabloids chronicling war, “night clubs,” and the horrors of… ::gasp:: stand up comedy!  “And then, in this dream, I see the leader of the archaeological party pounce with delight upon a small object in the dust, and I hear him cry ‘Here is their sacred talisman, the symbol of their religion!’ and I see him hold up to his conferères a cigar-lighter with the recipes for eight cocktails printed on it, and with a fountain-pen at one end of it and a flashlight at the other.”

  “I have found Americans out,’ writes a dear English friend, who is a good deal of a wag.  ‘They are <span class="red">gadget</span>-minded.  If they see a thing that needs to be done, they rig up a device, mechanical or mental, and make the thing do itself with no further bother.’  /  ‘As a result,’ he goes on,’ they have created a touch-the-button civilization, and I for one admire it.  Why go on doing a thing in the same old way, over and over again, if we can make a robot do it for us, and do it better?  My hat is of to the <span class="red">gadget</span> mind.’  /  To prove his point he refers to the Mark Twain story of the Connecticut Yankee at the Court of King Arthur.  The Yankee saw a saint swaying to and fro in an ecstasy of devotion, and to him it was a clear case of lost motion.  So he sat about and invented a device by which to harness the saint and use his motions to run a sewing machine.  In other words, he put religion to a practical use.  /  But, my friend goes on to say, there are some fields in which the <span class="red">gadget</span> mind will not work; and here he gets under our skin a bit.  We tried to achieve temperance by prohibition, and it failed.  We passed the law, wrote it into the Constitution and thought that the thing was done, and would stay done, or else would go on doing itself.  /  In the same way, he adds–rubbing it in rather sharply–we proposed the Pact of Paris; just another glorious <span class="red">gadget</span>.  We wrote a law outlawing war, renouncing it as a policy of nations.  The Law was solemnly signed; an dew thought the thing was done once for all.  But, alas, we see now that much remains to be done before war is ended.  /  In other words, my friend argues rightly, something more than a <span class="red">gadget</span> mind is needed to deal with the issues now before mankind.

  <strong>Fraprie, Frank R. and Franklin I. Jordan, 1937.</strong>
  “This book is the work of many authors.  No one person could ever think up half the things it contains.  It came out of the sweat and toil and practical experience of hundreds of enthusiastic photographers whose nimble wits have devised thse clever mechanical means for overcoming some of their many difficulties that stand between them and the attainment of their goal.  …  Photography is a many-sided hobby.  Among other diversions, it provides those of its devotees who like to tinker with tools a never ending incentive to make devices for which they have immediate and very practical use.  They ahve the fun of making things whose utility amply justifies the time and inexpensive materials required.  …  It is not the purpose of most of these ingenious <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> to take trade away from the photographic manufacturer.  Commercial products cannot usually be duplicated in the home workshop at anything like the cost of the manufactured article.  But here are many items not regularly marketed.  They would probably not have sufficient sale to warrant their manufacture, although many of them will prove invaluable to workers faced with problems similar to those of the writers.  We are confident that no one seriously engaged in photography, especially under makeshift conditions in the home where so much enthusiastic work is done, can fail to find in this book many hints which will save him not only an appreciable amount of time and money, but also much vexation of spirit.”

  “Gag, ‘a joke or imposture; a hoax.’  <span class="red">Gadget</span>, ‘a contrivance, object or device; a term often used to denote something novel’–slang.  Gimmick, ‘any small device used secretly by a magician in performing a trick.’”  “The author, while performing professionally, from 1908 until 1921, when he entered the radio broadcasting field at WLW, Cincinnati, believed he had originated many new ideas in magic, only to find that someone else had the same ideas.  A memorandum book, with the idea and date of its creation, with a signature of a witness, is necessary to prove originality in lawful court, and therefore, it is a suggestion, that should you develop a new idea in magic, follow this procedure.”

  <strong>Calahan, Harold Augustin, 1938.</strong>
  “But if a <span class="red">gadget</span> is a machine, an invention, a mechanical means of achieving a result, a wrinkle is a method of procedure.  Again our lexicographer, rating the word as colloquial, one step higher than slang, describes it as ‘a curious or ingenious notion; happy thought.’  I will accept that phrase ‘happy thought’ as particularly pat.  But to the seaman, a <span class="red">gadget</span> is a thing, and a wrinkle is a method, and both of them for most part unusual and unstandardized.” (viii))  /  That a <span class="red">gadget</span> is a solution that arises naturally out of the materials of the ship – similar to distinction made in US Court of Appeals case on the difference between a <span class="red">gadget</span> and an invention:  “In the long centuries in which men have sailed the seas, they have faced and solved oft-recurring problems.  When these problems present themselves on every passage and on every tack, the means of solving them are built right into the ship or her rigging.  ut when, as so often occurs, the problem arises out of some unusual situation, the sailor is forced to turn inventor.  He calls upon all his ingenuity.  He summons to his aid his past experience with the solution of some similar problem.  And perhaps he remembers, with that strange race memory which is often mis-called instinct, some similar experience of a sea-going ancestor.”  /  “Our lexicographers define a <span class="red">gadget</span> as ‘anything the name of which cannot be recalled at the moment,’ and in parentheses, they add (Slang, U.S. Navy.)  But the name has a broader meaning and a riper antiquity than the dictionary credits.  I believe the term is older than the navy itself, ad far too deeply imbedded in the language to merit the transitory stigma of slang.  A landsman’s synonyms for <span class="red">gadget</span> are thing-um-bob, widget, what-do-yer-call-it, do-funny.  A sailor’s synonym is gilhickey, although a purist would make a distinction by never using the term gilhickey except to distinguish one <span class="red">gadget</span> from another.  The first <span class="red">gadget</span> is the <span class="red">gadget</span>.  The second <span class="red">gadget</span> in any situation in which two appear is the gilhickey.”  (viii)  /  The temporality/longevity/life-span of a <span class="red">gadget</span>–“But it must not be considered that the term is applied merely as a temporary substitute for an object’s true name.  Most of the unusual things about a ship go nameless forever.  When an invention becomes so standardized that it acquires a name, it ceases to be a <span class="red">gadget</span> except for those brief periods when its distinguishing name is forgotten.  But there are thousands of unusual things about a ship or a yacht that were born <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and will remain <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> as long as they are used.  They are the inventions that solve the rare problems, the machines that are unnecessary on most vessels and at most times and are therefore nameless.” That at any moment, a <span class="red">gadget</span> could become a wrinkle and vice versa–the difference between a tool and a procedure is not readily identifiable:  “I have been sore put to it to organize this book.  For I am dealing with concepts that have thus far resisted organization so well that they have avoided being tagged with names.  Also it is pretty hard to tell where a <span class="red">gadget</span> begins and a wrinkle ends or vice versa.  Take a familiar example.  You are about to tie two lines together.  You tie them into a weaver’s knot.  Standard practice so far–no <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, no wrinkles.  The nrealizing that ther eis going to be a terrific strain on that line and that the knot will be pulled so tight that you will never be able to untie it again, you decide to slip a toggle into the knot.  That’s a happy thought, for you can always take a hammer and drive out the toggle and the knot will be loose.  What is that toggle–a winkle or a <span class="red">gadget</span>?  Now suppose we decide that the strain is going to be so great that it will be difficult to drive out an ordinary toggle.  So we use a large fid whose sloping shape assures us that the slightest driving with the hammer will loosen the knot.  Is the wrinkle now a <span class="red">gadget</span>?  Or if the small end of the fid is greased to make it slip more easily through the the tight turns of the knot, does it become a wrinkle again?  I don’t know and I don’t pretend to try to find out.  The line of demarkation is too indistinct.  So I shall write about <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and wrinkles without worrying much about branding them with their proper names.”

But what is not so often observed in that these <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are not only labor-saving but brain-saving, thought-saving; and it seems an inescapable conclusion that a correlative mental incompetence is being induced.  /  A certain amount of resistance seems necessary for the proper functioning of mental and moral attributes, as it is for that of physical attributes.  In any of these three departments of life, if you can get results without effort, and habitually do so, the capacity for making the effort dwindles.  Whatever takes away the opportunity for effort, whatever obviates or reduces the need for making it, is therefore to some degree deleterious.

A COCOANUT, A COCOANUT, A COCOANUT A DAY / WILL BUY YOUR WIFE A GADGET AND KEEP THE FROWNS AWAY.”  turns out to be a cocoanut opener:  “The Guenon Perfection Automatic Cocoanut Decapitator.”  “It was so much more esthetic to have neatly decapitated cocoanuts, instead of the old kind that merely had their tops bashed in with a rock, that no self-respecting monkey-family dared serve any other kind.  And besides that, the <span class="red">gadget</span> was such fun to play with.  Many a previously-industrious husband would stay at home half the morning fooling with the Decapitator when he ought to have been out picking cocoanuts for the support of his family.”

  “His ‘crash rodeo,’ however, is more than an exhibition of nerve.  It is a demonstration of precise planning and of the value of mechanical safeguards.  For <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> play a stellar role in his escapes from death.”  i.e.:  “A sponge-rubber kneeling pad, of the type used by housewives and gardeners, is fastened to the top of the rear fender.  This enables the stunt man to remove the saddle post and sit far back on the machine, with his body low over the gas tank.  …  Another safety measure is a pad fastened tightly to the top of the motor-cycle frame.”

  <strong>Buxbaum, Edwin C., 1939.</strong>
  “We have been accused of being a nation of <span class="red">gadget</span> collectors; collectors of camera accessories that are bought solely for the purpose of acquiring more <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  So what?  What finer <span class="red">gadget</span> can you acquire than a gleaming telephoto lens, a combination of steel, glass, and chromium that is beautiful to lok at, that functions like a piece of clockwork and that is a thrill to own?  Acquire your <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> if you can afford it.  Buy more lenses, more filters, more copying devices, lanterns, enlargers, and every other device you can afford if you will use them.  Learn how they operate; learn the function of every colored filter you get, try out the enlarger under every different condition you can think of and then you will have a real excuse in buying all the different things.  But, if you don’t use htem, then there is no excuse for them and eventually you will sell them to some other amateur who will make use of them and at a bargain.”  SAME ISSUE:  Beers, Nathan Thomas.  “The Miniature Camera”:  “<span class="red">Gadget</span>s and Short-Cuts.–In the ustle which frequently becomes necessary in the processing of exposures made in connection with one’s profesiosnal work, any <span class="red">gadget</span> or short-cut calculated to save time is certain to be acceptable.  There are many of us who have learned the convenience of the miniature camera in making photographic records…  […]  Figure 1 shows a little <span class="red">gadget</span> which has served us very satisfactorily as a rest or cradle in which to place the reel while being loaded.  The M-shaped section may be turned up of tin or aluminum, or made of wood.  Ours was made of a sheet of Monel metal and is mounted on a block of wood on the bottom of which four felt corn-plasters serve to give a little grip on the table or bench.  […]  Figure 2 shows how a tell-tale made by a bit of folded card, and slipped into the finder-=clip, tells at a glance exactly the contents of the film magazine or whether the camera be empty.  Where one makes use of two or more cameras of this type this little <span class="red">gadget</span> saves much time.  On one side may be printed or written the name of the film being used and on the reverse side the word ‘empty.’”

  “We admit that, like other camera users, we desire occasionally–and, when we can afford it, fulfill the desire–to trade in our camera for a new one, one equipped with the newer <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  They are hard to resist, those handsomely contrived, new camera models, not only because they are good to look at but the new <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are real improvements and signify advances in camera design.  Nevertheless, no matter how long or short the period during which a camera is actually in our position it was a new one when we bought it and that, for us at least, is important.”

  “In other words, I should not be surprised if the youngest generation were taking a realistic view of politics.  They are probably looking at government simply as a <span class="red">gadget</span>, and deciding that the trouble with it is nothing but the old notorious trouble with <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>–which is that they mostly don’t work.  The scout’s young men may be taking the practical, hard-boiled view that government is a <span class="red">gadget</span> which is meant to work for the good of society while you sleep, and is not doing it.  This is a good sound view.  Looking at government as a <span class="red">gadget</span>, here are a few questions which come up.  …  First, then, since the governmental <span class="red">gadget</span> is supposed to work for the rest of society, how can it best do that?”

  “who can assist by reason of the right contacts with large business interests, in exploring an invention as universally applicable as steam.  A test plant is nearly completed and together with the patent situation amply financed.  This is not another <span class="red">gadget</span> but something of epoch-making importance.  There is nothing like it in existence and the art is susceptible of profitable development in a hundred directions for years to come.  The man is more important than the $5,000 which he must be prepared to lose, but the chances are better than 50% for him to make a million, if the test plant operates, and extensive and expensive research and independent checking indicate it will.”

  “First Prize:  <span class="red">Gadget</span> Contest at the Neenah-Menasha Meeting of the Central States Sewage Works Association, Oct. 20, 1983.  This <span class="red">gadget</span> was more than a <span class="red">gadget</span> and would be classed as an apparatus.  It was Don E. Bloodgood’s apparatus for determining the rate of oxygen utilization by activated sludge.  This apparatus is described by him in the paper which he presented at the above meeting, published on page 927, Vol. 10 (November, 1938) of This Journal.  The cost is very small compared to well known apparatus on the market, and is said to be more accurate.”

  “Here again France is facing a situation which is common to all highly industrialized countries. The so-called bottlenecks of industrial production are looming large in Germany, England, even the United States, and professional economists everywhere are coming to insist that you may have large unemployment along with a serious shortage of skilled labor? indeed, paradoxically enough, the labor shortage may to a considerable extent be responsible for unemployment. The failure of one highly specialized factory manufacturing a particular <span class="red">gadget</span> may hold up a great deal of industrial production which depends directly or indirectly upon that particular <span class="red">gadget</span>. All that the November decrees did was to charge the Axe Committee with studying these bottlenecks and devising plans for a more effective distribution of labor.”

  “Press Conference was all over yesterday but President Roosevelt called it back, holding aloft a small mechanical <span class="red">gadget</span> over which he appeared to be as happy as a boy. Asking if reporters could remember the old cyclometer that used to record mileage on bicycles, President Roosevelt proudly explained that this new contrivance worked after the same fashion, to measure the electricity used in a small house. And instead of costing $10.00 which is what the big meter costs, this new one would cost about halt that. Mr. Roosevelt was so pleased with it that he held it aloft from his swivel chair all the time he talked”

  “Napoleon decorated Joseph Marie Jacquard for his invention of Jacquard cards, those perforated little pieces of paper that control looms in such a way as to make them weave predetermined designs repetitiously. Now produced by automatic machinery, these cards are still expensive. Inasmuch as a separate card is needed for each thread of weft, a mere 10-inch design may require 800 cards which cost a little more than $100.00 to make. Not so with the Lefler robot. The cost has plummeted to $5.00. With this surprisingly simple <span class="red">gadget</span>, the most intricate designs may be faithfully duplicated. Merely writing one’s name on a copper plate is sufficient to initiate an action that eventuates in the appearance of // that name woven into cloth with every shade and inflection perfectly preserved. A delicate electric finger plays over the inked copper master and delivers an electronically-amplified current to a series of small electromagnets each of which controls a needle of the loom.”

  “A radio receiver, in addition to being a musical instrument, is also unfortunately a piece of furniture and a complex scientific <span class="red">gadget</span>. As a musical instrument it finds its response limited at high frequencies by station-crowding in the wavelength bands, which at present sets a legal upper limit of 5000 cycles, while furniture fashion cuts off the low frequencies by preventing the use of a suitable loud-speaker.”
