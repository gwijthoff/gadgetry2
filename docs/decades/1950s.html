  “Besides its many handsome diagrams and striking photographs, it possessed a side pocket containing a collapsible, multicolored dodecahedron (held to­gether by rubber bands which made it self-erecting when removed from its hid­ ing place), a set of motion-picture ‘cards which when rapidly riffled displayed cer­tain geometrical laws, a pair of red and green Cagliostro spectacles which con­ferred three dimensions on the book’s several anaglyphs, and a few other equally ingenious <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>. Dr. Steinhaus’ introduction was so modest and amiable as to disarm all criticism. “You are right,” he said, “there is no system in this book; important things are omitted and trifles are emphasized. Many things do not deserve the name of mathematics, and the author himself does not seem to know what his aim really was in publish­ ing his ‘mathematical snapshots.’ They are too scientific for a child and too childish for a mathematician.” Still, this was excessively modest. For Steinhaus succeeded not only in serving up a re­ past of mathematical objects “as pecu­liar as the most exotic beast or bird,” but his book, for all its grab-bag disorder and despite the fact that his morsels rarely more than tickled the appetite for the strange and wonderful, afforded an amazing display of the richness, the va­riety and especially the interrelatedness of mathematical thought. His snapshots had a dual role. They were often beau­tiful and fascinating in themselves and from that standpoint it was unnecessary to ask what they meant. Yet they were also pictorial representations of purely abstract relations possessing universal validity. Thus they could illumine for the thoughtful reader something of the nature of intellectual process-how we are able to interpret the physical world and make coherent and useful systems describing its behavior. The very mish­ mash quality of the book serves to carry out this purpose.”

  “The attempts through the years to get a broader, looser conception of patents than the Constitution contemplates have been persistent.  The Patent Office, like most administrative agencies, has looked with favor on the opportunity which the exercise of discretion affords to expand its own jurisdiction.  And so it has placed a host of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> under the armor of patents – <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that obviously have had no place in the constitutional scheme of advancing scientific knowledge. A few that have reached this Court show the pressure to extend monopoly to the simplest of devices:  Hotchkiss v. Greenwood, 11 How. 248: doorknob made of clay, rather than metal or wood, where different shaped door knobs had previously been made of clay.  Rubber-Tip Pencil Co. v. Howard, 20 Wall. 498: rubber caps put on wood pencils to serve as erasers.  Union Paper Collar Co. v. Van Dusen, 23 Wall. 530: making collars of parchment paper where linen paper and linen had previously been used.  Page 340 U. S. 157  Brown v. Piper, 91 U. S. 37: a method for preserving fish by freezing them in a container operating in the same manner as an ice cream freezer.  Reckendorfer v. Faber, 92 U. S. 347: inserting a piece of rubber in a slot in the end of a wood pencil to serve as an eraser.  Dalton v. Jennings, 93 U. S. 271: fine thread placed across open squares in a regular hairnet to keep hair in place more effectively.  Double-Pointed Tack Co. v. Two Rivers Mfg. Co., 109 U. S. 117: putting a metal washer on a wire staple.”  etc. etc.  “The patent involved in the present case belongs to this list of incredible patents which the Patent Office has spawned. The fact that a patent as flimsy and as spurious as this one has to be brought all the way to this Court to be declared invalid dramatically illustrates how far our patent system frequently departs from the constitutional standards which are supposed to govern.”

  “Well, I do it thisaway. The glass rotates while the template slides over it, back and forth. The linkage keeps the template always vertical. Throw on the abrasive and both glass and template automatically go paraboloid, the only curve we know of that can be made that way. Starting, say, with a hemisphere, or any segment of a sphere, and a thin, circular template, you can keep going and get any focal length you want. Of course, the above is a convex paraboloid but it works equally well on a concave one.  /   The reason why this <span class="red">gadget</span> works this way lies in the equation of the pa­raboloid and the fact that every section cut from a paraboloid, like a, b, c, d, e, is a parabola and all are identical.”

These folders, which aim to create a romantic atmosphere, are labeled Rocky Mountain View, American Venice, Marmaduke Manor, Phoenix Park, Pacific Shores, Aztec Village, Wampum City, Quahog Beach, Casabianca, or Capri. Their streets are named after fruits, Presidents, ballplayers, movie stars, Indians, Eskimos, departed local celebrities, Scotch clans, and Riviera resorts. There are usually guarded references to a magnificent community clubhouse where good old Crestfallen Manor still stands, and to murmuring hemlocks, vast expanses of sandy beach on salt or fresh water, and so forth.”

  “A small boy, I am told ran to the open door of a radio shop and asked, ‘How much is television?’ What a question indeed. How much is love, freedom, honor? How much is God? How much is community? The lad’s question was direct and simple; but as deep as depth; as long as forever; as high as the farthest unimagined star. What he means of course was how many dollars would it cost him to get one of those mysterious <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that catch pictures from the air. But television, community, life’s ultimate reallties are never purchasable in dollars and cents; yet there is real meaning in asking how much they cost.”

  “How much more Know-How is needed to make human life obsolete?  Is there any known <span class="red">gadget</span> for controlling a rampant Know-How?  The lady in the ad has found a mechanic substitute for moral choice?”  “As the ad implies, know-how is at once a technical and a moral sphere.  It is a duty for a woman to love her husband and also to love that soap that will make her husband love her.  It is a duty to be glamorous, cheerful, efficient, and, so far as possible, to run the home like an automatic factory.  This ad also draws attention to the tendency of the modern housewife, after a premarital spell in the business world, to embrace marriage and children but not housework.  Emotionally, she repudiates physical tasks with the same confection that she pursues hygiene.  And so the ad promises her a means of doing physical work without hating the husband who has dragged her into household drudgery.  /  To purchase <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that relieve this drudgery and thus promote domestic affection is, therefore, a duty, too.  And so it is that not only labor-saving appliances but food and nylons (‘your legs owe it to their audience’) are consumed and promoted with moral fervor.  /  But <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and gimmicks did not begin as physical objects, nor are they only to be understood as such today.  Benjamin Franklin, protean prototype and professor of know-how, is equally celebrated for both his material and psychological technology.  In his Autobiography, still a central feature of Yankee moral structure, he tells, for example, how he hit upon a system of moral bookkeeping which would enable any man to achieve perfection in several months.  The trick is to select only one fault at a time for deletion and by concentration and persistence the moral slate will soon be clean.  Related to this system was his discovery of various techniques for winning friends and influencing people which are still as serviceable as ever.”

  “Appellee-plaintiffs sued for the infringement of three patents relating to steering gear idler arm assemblies of automobiles. Appellants-defendants,2  asserted that the patents were invalid because of lack of invention and that there was no infringement. The trial court upheld validity, found and enjoined infringement, and ordered an accounting. Later Jamco was found to be in contempt for violation of the injunction.  […]  [<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> as commonsense solution to a problem:]  Jamco asserts that these devices do not constitute invention, were anticipated by the prior art, and at the most show only mechanical improvements which should have been obvious to a person having ordinary skill in the art.  […]  The crucial issue is whether ‘the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains.’  […]  The dividing line between what results from mechanical ability and what displays inventive genius is ill-defined. Perhaps no hard and fast definitive rule can or should be established. We have here combination patents utilizing such well and commonly known elements as bearings, grease seals, washers, bushings, nuts and bolts. In Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. v. Supermarket Equipment Corp., 340 U.S. 147, 151, and 152, 71 S.Ct. 127, 129, 95 L.Ed. 162, it was said that ‘the concept of invention is inherently elusive when applied to combination of old elements’ and that ‘courts should scrutinize combination patent claims with a care proportioned to the difficulty and improbability of finding invention in an assembly of old elements.’  […] Recognizing that patentability is a question of law for the court,13  we cannot say that here there is a <span class="red">gadget</span> as opposed to an invention. Certainly in a particular environment, the steering mechanism of motor vehicles, the peculiar and difficult problem of stabilizing that mechanism and protecting if from undue wear is solved in an expert, inexpensive and effective manner which attains an improved result. If the distinctive arrangement of the known elements would be apparent to a skilled mechanic, such fact is established neither by an examination of the devices nor by the evidence adduced at the trial. From the record presented to us the novel and distinctive combinations which make up the three patents in question require ‘greater skill and higher thought than would be expected of an ordinary mechanic trained in the art.’14  In the circumstances, Jamco has not sustained the burden of overcoming the presumption of validity by clear and convincing evidence.”

  <strong>Gardner, Martin, 1952.</strong>
  “Late in the 18th century Charles Stanhope, third Earl, a British statesman and inventor, built the first true logic machine, the Stanhope Demonstrator.  The Demonstrator was a crude <span class="red">gadget</span> for solving syllogisms.  A syllogism consists of a major premise and a minor premise, the first making a statement about a “predicate term” and a “middle term,” the second about the same middle term and a “subject term.” By eliminating the middle term one arrives at the correct conclusion as to the relation of subject to predicate. In Stanhope’s Demonstrator the middle term was represented by a small wooden panel called the “holon.” It had a frame through which other panels could be slid to cover all or part of the holon. A panel of gray wood, representing the subject, was pushed in from the left, and one of red glass, representing the predicate, was pushed in over this from the right.”

Only two authors (the first and last) weigh the tremendous problems that will follow the advances described by the other six. Each of these two speaks with the circumspection of one who elects to drift with the current rather than inquire too critically as to its direction.

Perhaps courts, so far as possible, should leave mechanical theories to mechanics and engineers and theories on science to scientists.

The force of gravity acting upon each log held it down upon the water and its buoyancy, responding to the law of displaced liquids, held it up.  When some force acted to overturn the raft, these two natural forces were brought into conflict, because either one log would have to rise against the law of gravity, or one would have to sink against the law of displaced liquids, before the raft could overturn.  To the extent that the two forces acted against each other, an entire new force, stability, wasp resent in the raft.  /  For good or evil, great as the invention of the atomic bomb may have been, the general invention produced no new force; it only released forces already present in nature.  /  The chieftain may only have produced a ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ in the raft, but it still embodied a force which did not have even an incorporeal former existence.  /  Countless such forces are embodied in the mechanical devices that surround us.

Admires the simple language, written for a general public, of Justice Hunt’s decision, wishes Douglas had consulted it.  Hunt:  “The combination to be patentable must produce a different force or effect, or result in the combined forces or process, from that given by the separate parts.  There must be a new result produced by their union: if not, it is only an aggregation of old elements.”  Ends up arguing that lead pencil and attached rubber that “Not only is there no new result, but there is no joint operation.”  “

It  resembles  very  closely  the way an engineer may test the stability of a  transmission  system:  he  applies  posi­tive  feedback  to disturb  the  system  and observes how effectively the system’s in­herent  negative  feedback  operates  to damp  the  disturbance  and  restore  equi­librium.”

  <strong>Weaver, Warren, 1955.</strong>
  “I do have some familiarity with modern high speed computing devices and other optical-electronic-mechanical techniques for handling information; and I have had some contacts with–and surely a lively interest in–the recent developments of communication theory” (613).  The “patent office problem” is, to Weaver, “a fascinating instance of a rather common modern dilemma, namely, the essential collapse of a communication network due to over-complication; or somewhat more precisely, due to the use of an outmoded procedure which is not capable of coping with the presently existing degree of complication.  This is, in fact, a dramatic instance of the situation not uncommon in the general world of scholarship, in which a vast and intricate tangle of documents gets jammed into an unusable pile between two minds” (613).  “There are slightly less than three million U.S. Patents.  If we add the foreign patents and the items of technical literature available in the Patent Office, the total swells to about seven million.  The corresponding figure was only 1.2 million in 1900; and the patents of today average about one-third longer, and are certainly much more complex in their technical and scientific detail.  In the terminology of modern communications theory, in which a ‘bit’ of information is the basic unit (essentially the answer to a single ‘Yes-No’ question), the total amount of information which must today be dealt with in the Patent office has been estimated to be of the order of fifty billion bits [CONVERT 50 BILLION BITS TO GB?  1 million GB?  =  1,000 TB?] (614).  Goes on to survey different kinds of “mechanical aids to data handling.”  /  A question of classification – beginning to work out the dimensions of a relational database:  “When does a Document A exhibit inhibitory relevance to another Document B?” (619).  * * * Is it unreasonable to think that, if one just looks deep enough with trained and observant eyes, he might see an inner logical simplicity behind all the confusing proliferation of things and ideas that turn up in the Patent Office?  Just because of its emphasis on inner logical simplicity, and on generality to encompass multiplicity, the point of view of mathematics would seem to be the promising one here.  How, for example, does one ever define ‘containers’ in the everyday nouns and adjectives of commerce in a way which is at once simple enough, general enough, and critical enough so that can possibly cope with the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> someone will think of tomorrow?  But what object can anyone ever think up that will not be subject to the basic inner concepts of connectivity as they are developed in topology?” (621-2)  Biological metaphor for an “organic sort” of classification system, “For it must be able to grow and to adjust itself to an ever changing environment.”  (622).  “I realize that I have succeeded in defining, in impersonal terms, Professor John von Neumann; and I also realize that the Atomic Energy Commission has him all booked up at the moment.  But at least he proves that such leadership is not unthinkable.” (623)”

  “Orville Goerger is Copy Director of Commerical Letter, Inc., a St. Louis mail-advertising agency.

He is also guest lecturer on direct-mail copy at Washington University and St. Louis University; contributor of direct-mail articles to various trade publications; creator of award-winning <span class="red">gadget</span> campaigns in the Direct-mail Advertising Association’s annual competition; member of the Board of Governors, Advertising Club of St. Louis; and Chairman of the Skit-Writing Committee for the Advertising Club’s annual Gridiron Dinner” (210).  “All too often the direct-mail user planning a <span class="red">gadget</span> mailing spends most of his planning time looking for a <span class="red">gadget</span> that is new, different, and unusual.  /  Yet mere newness is not always a guarantee of resultfulness.  Nor is the complexity or elaborate nature of the <span class="red">gadget</span> any measure of the success it will achieve.  Indeed, in many cases, best results are obtained when a relatively old idea is dug out and re-used.  /  “This may be a bit hard to believe in these days when many of the new letter <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> rival the atom bomb in their complexity.  There are rubber-band-powered butterflies that spring out of a letter when it is opened, secret chemical processes that do magical things to a mailing piece when water is applied, Rube Goldberg mechanisms that build elaborate pop-ups when the mailing is unfolded–and literally hundreds of others.  All are ingenious and do attract a large degree of attention.  /  Yet, surprisingly enough, their effectiveness is sometimes less than that of a relatively simple <span class="red">gadget</span> like, for example, a burnt match.  Both in the cost of the <span class="red">gadget</span> and in the result it secures, the simple <span class="red">gadget</span> frequently outscores its more expensive and elaborate brother.  /  Perhaps the reason for this is that the idea behind the <span class="red">gadget</span>’s use is more important than the <span class="red">gadget</span> itself [ital. in original].  In fact, a too elaborate <span class="red">gadget</span> will usually overpower the copy; the reader remembers the <span class="red">gadget</span>, but the message of the mailing piece may never register with him.  /  One cardinal rule for using a <span class="red">gadget</span> is to keep the <span class="red">gadget</span> secondary in importance to the theme of the mailing piece.  It is obviously difficult to do this when the <span class="red">gadget</span> you are using is deliberately designed to dominate the mailing.  /  Another good rule for <span class="red">gadget</span> usage is to keep the <span class="red">gadget</span> merely a stepping stone into the copy.  A good <span class="red">gadget</span> is one that provides an interesting introduction to your message; it is a master of ceremonies whose duty it is to build up the real star of the show – your copy.  A good <span class="red">gadget</span> never steals the show from the star or makes that star seem insignificant by comparison.  The more sensational you make your <span class="red">gadget</span>, the more difficult you make it for your copy message to hold its own.  /  Usually both of these objectives can be achieved by using a <span class="red">gadget</span> or novelty effect of a simple sort.  When a simple <span class="red">gadget</span> is used, you are literarily forced into developing a powerful idea for tying in your message.  In most cases a powerful idea plus the appeal of a good <span class="red">gadget</span> is almost certain to click.”  The seven <span class="red">gadget</span> ideas are: “a penny <span class="red">gadget</span>,” literally a penny in the envelope; A piece of string, “One reason for its appeal is that it permits motion in the mailing; by fastening only one end of the string, the other end swings freely and catches the eye”;  a feather; the “burnt-edge letter,” “while not strictly a <span class="red">gadget</span>, the burnt-edge letter is so dramatic and so simple that it should not be overlooked when it fits your scheme”; cotton; postage stamp, so that “people are getting something for nothing”; miniature photograph”

  “As I returned to the study MIss Dukas explained to me that Eric Rogers, who teaches physics at Princeton, had made a <span class="red">gadget</span> for Einstein as a present for his 76th birthday, and that Professor Einstein had been delighted with it.  Back in  the  study,  I  saw  Einstein  take  from the  corner  of  the  room what  looked  like a  curtain  rod  five  feet  tall,  at  the  top  of which  was  a  plastic  sphere about  four inches  in diameter. Coming  up  from  the rod  into  the  sphere  was  a  small  plastic tube  about  two  inches  long,  terminating in  the  center  of  the  sphere.  Out  of  this tube there came a string with a little ball at  the  end.  “You  see,”  said  Einstein, “this  is  designed  as  a  model  to  illustrate the  equivalence  principle. The  little  ball is  attached  to  a  string,  which  goes  into the  little  tube  in  the  center  and  is  at­tached  to  a  spring.  The  spring  pulls  on the  ball,  but   it  cannot  pull the ball up and  into  the  little  tube  because  the spring  is  not  strong  enough  to  overcome the  gravitational  force which pulls down on the ball.” A  big  grin  spread  across his face  and  his  eyes  twinkled  with  delight as  he  said:  “And  now  the  equivalence principle.”  Grasping  the  <span class="red">gadget</span>  in  the middle  of  the  long  brass  curtain  rod,  he thrust it upward until the sphere touched the  ceiling.  “Now  I  will  let  it  drop,”  he said,  “and  according  to  the  equivalence principle  there  will  be  no  gravitational force.  So  the  spring  will  now  be  strong enough  to  bring  the  little  ball  into  the plastic  tube.”  With  that  he  suddenly  let the  <span class="red">gadget</span>  fall  freely  and  vertically, guiding it with his hand, until the bottom reached  the  floor.  The  plastic  sphere  at the  top  was  now  at  eye  level.  Sure enough, the ball nestled in the tube.”

  “Just where the first use in libraries of mechanical trivia was made is no doubt, thoroughly documented in the literature.  Quite possibly, the first ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ to gain general acceptance was some device as simple but as effective as the rubber date stamp.  Clipped to the end of a pencil, this little gem has has saved thousands of man-hours, and assisted in relegating ‘library script’ to the category of interesting leftovers in the card catalogs of university libraries. […] the machines and devices which are to be discussed here are those which may be regarded as simple extensions of the hander mind and which are designed to speed some operation or to relieve muscular strain, but not those intended to alter substantially the methods commonly used in libraries.  /  The common aim in introducing tools or machines into almost any process is to reduce the time or energy required to perform some operation or to produce a more uniformly satisfactory result.  To stick to this rule in the application of what may be referred to as ‘<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>’ is sometimes difficult; many of these devices have a kind of fascination for some librarians which occasionally obscures the true economics of their application” (239).  “The popularity of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is attested to by the space allotted to them in such professional journals as the A.L.A. Bulletin [the “<span class="red">Gadget</span>s, Gismos, and Gimmicks” column], the Library Journal and PNLA Quarterly in the form of regular columns or departments and of articles proclaiming the success of their various applications.  A few examples of the types of items escrowed briefly in the PNLA Quarterly for January 1956 are: visible files, copying machines, paper cutter, copy follower, and routing forms.  Often these are already in use in libraries, but the wide range of materials listed shows the extent to which librarians search for things which may speed up their work.”  * * * See the “review of the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> used in one library” broken down by genre, as well as discussion of how they are arranged at work stations “so that the work in which they are used may be performed in a consistent and logical flow,” on p. 242.”

  “It is safe to say that few of us Americans fully realize the progress this country has made in a handful of years. The editor of the Port Gibson, Mississippi, Reveille touches on this in relating how that town has improved its community life. In 1928, he said, “Port Gibson was struggling along with flickering lights, and a few small motors, which seemed they might burn out any minute, until the town finally voted to sell its worn out municipal plant to the Mississippi Power &amp; Light Company. “Had there been television in 1928,” he said, “we think it would have been useless in Port Gibson, to say nothing of home freezers, electric refrigerators, washers, dryers, garbage disposals, industrial motors, air conditioning, and a host of other <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> run by that wonderful force which no one can adequately define, but everyone calls electric power.””

  “But it may also be due to the style of the book. This  is  more  journalistic  than  literary, and sometimes the choice of words is not too  particular.  For  example,  it  quotes Samuel Butler to the effect that the “hen is  the  egg’s  device  for  laying  another egg.” Now what  Samuel  Butler  actually said,  at least in his  Life and Habit,  was something different,  namely,  that “a hen is  only  an  egg’s  way  of making  another egg.”  He  was  worrying  about  hens  not as <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, but as individuals. The lapse is  an interesting  one,  an intimation that in  the  authors’  minds  problems  of  in­dividuality belong to the  19th century of the  old-fashioned  nature  rather  than  to the 20th century of population  genetics. Yet the paradox remains that the fascina­tion of biology to the novice as well as to the  specialist depends even  now  on  the relationship  of  the  individual  to  his group,  and  not  on  considerations  of  the group alone.”

Among the items which have been surefire crowd stoppers in the past are the little gimmicks–the better mousetrap, so to speak–which show at a glance how to do something quicker and cleaner.  Some of those shown in New York, however, are a bit obscure as far as practical purpose is concerned, but they still are interesting enough to win attention.  …  The <span class="red">Gadget</span> Show was initiated last year as a showplace for thousands of unknown innovations that flow from the American inventive mind.

  “Since considerable heat (ill-wind) can be created thru poor presentations, sloppy work and phony items, it was editable that a <span class="red">gadget</span> workers’ protective organization make an appearance.  The new non-profit Exhibitors Association of America, headquartered in California, has been incorporated with the avowed aim of stopping unfair practices bothy by and against demonstrators.  It would improve the level of the demonstration industry and protect it from space rent and percentage gouging.  /  The person working <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is all things to all viewers, wherever the public congregates.  If they want humor he has it; the same goes for the many other qualities necessary to successful entertainment on a personnel level.

If he is a top-notcher, however, he could get 75 per cent of his tip (audience) to vote him into Congress as easily as spring (spend) for a sale.  /  Basically speaking, the new and novel item is a traffic-stopper, enabling the demonstrator to build his tip.  He presents it in a [sic] appealing way through humor, stories, etc., hooding his tip’s attention while presenting the item.  Then comes his close (windup) and the request for sales.  Then comes a rehash of his spiel to convince additional viewers who have not sprung and also to hold the tip, which in itself is a good way to stop more traffic as passers-by gather to see what’s going on.  /  The business is a small one and far from the usual housewares salesmanship.  It has workers (commission agents) who act for the leaders, those pace-setters in the field.  There are independents, who do their own buying and renting of space, and who work alone except for an occasional partner or member of the family.  /  The field’s code of ethics is not one that a banker would follow.  It is generally a cash-on-the-line business, but it is not improper to owe money for merchandise when one is tapped out (broke), but eventual payment is a must if a worker expects to last in the industry.  Demonstrators playing a red one (successful fair date or celebration) are prone to help out another clansman by lending money or merchandise.  Credit information is entirely word of mouth, however, and reputations are soon established for honesty and reliability.  /  Altho most demonstrators work on limited capital a great deal of money can be made quickly and lost just as fast, in the trade.  Experience brings with it the ability to judge the quality and potential earnings of a location, and the knack of securing an occasional ex for <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> at certain fairs, on traveling shows, and at stores.  Sometimes a respected worker can control all <span class="red">gadget</span> locations on a fairground by proving his competence to the fair secretary.  /  There is considerable disillusionment in the business,w which is constantly having its personnel weeded out as johnny-come-latelys fold up at the first sign of hardship.  Old-timers know, tho that rainy days soon pass, and when they do, the clan is busy at work building more tips and pocketing the profits.”

That was 20 years ago, and it’s on the scene again.  /  For example:  Three years ago, choppers became a hot item, starting with a Swiss import retailing at $1.98.  American versions, like Rotomatic and Chopomatic, competed with the Swiss Blitzhacker.  Price was $2.98.  Mass production overtook the price and stamped it down to $1.98 and even lower in some cases, causing some perplexity by price-conscious demonstrators.  Rotomatic was replaced by the Imperial Food Chopper during this period.  But this price confusion was followed by a waning popularity and it was decided to produce a super model with a bigger bowl, capable of holding more and bigger vegetables and eliminating the need to slice some of them down to chopper size.  Now we have the Grown Imperial.  /  From 1952-‘54 the handy little Mouli Grater ($1 retail) nurtured a company which has taken on a wider line of kitchen <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  There is a $2.98 Julienne and $4.98 Salad-Maker (retail).  /  Others among the wide assortment of plastic and metal gizmos directed at the American housewife–and so artfully demonstrated thruout the land–include a handy radish cutter which creates a radish flowered…”  /  * * * “<span class="red">Gadget</span>s used to be set out on counters in cartons, but lately the poly bag has become a common display method.

The basket has come up so strongly that one manufacturer, fearful of rapid over-saturation, is offering a combination package.  This contains the French basket, a pastry maker, and pastryman’s cloth.  /  But there is virtually no end to the number of handy little <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> offered as time-savers for the American kitchen.

  “Technological innovations have been as important as language, art and science in distinguishing man from beast.  And although technological innovation antedates our species, it has never before occupied so great a share of man’s energies.  /  Our works are built on old foundations––on obsolete inventions such as the hand-ax and the bow no less than on inventions that have survived, such as agriculture and the wheel.  But during most of human history technological art accumulated gradually.  Up to a few hundred years ago, the techniques of civilized life had scarcely advanced beyond the best achievements of the ancients.  Then our control over the forces of nature began to increase at an explosive rate.  […]  In this article we shall examine some recent advances to see what light they throw on the creative process in the complex of technology today.  What do we mean by technological innovation?  Surely not the tail fins on this year’s automobile, nor a new catch on a refrigerator door.  A true innovation must perform some important function.  It may do a wholly new job or do an old job far better or far more cheaply than it was done before.  […]  …I will discuss some reasonably noncontroversial innovations made at the Bell Telephone Laboratories, where I am employed, under circumstances which I believe I understand.  […]  As our final example of innovation in technology let us consider briefly the microwave-relay system which carries telephone conversations and television programs across the country without the use of cables.  The key word here is ‘system.’  The problem was not to make a particular device, but to weld a great number of devices into a complex whole.  Some of the deices were available at the start; others had to be developed.  But the chief innovation was the choice, among the many alternative methods and devices, of the best combination of methods and devices–the system as a whole, and not merely its adequate parts.  […]  [Harold T.] Friis’s main problem, then, was not to invent this <span class="red">gadget</span> or that, but to choose the best course, technically and economically, among a bewildering array of possibilities.  The art of making such a choice is usually called systems engineering when the alternative means and the required knowledge are all at hand.  When they are not, I suppose it should be called systems research.  By 1948 the results of the research of Friis and his colleagues had been embodied in an experimental system which was installed between New York and Boston.  This was the prototype of the transcontinental microwave system, which was put into service in 1951.”

The psychological mechanisms described need not be characteristic of typical cultural attitudes, although there seems generally to be something derogatory in the use of the term, <span class="red">gadget</span>” (339).  “The machine deals with the external world directly and, although there are many exceptions, strives to create order from disorder. One can say that it is similar to a secondary process operation which takes the unorganized and gives it organization. In most cases a human being is required to operate machines. The <span class="red">gadget</span> differs from the complex machine in that it minimizes the importance of the human being whereas the ordinary machine augments a person’s capacity to do work which requires secondary process operations. For example, typewriting is the use of a machine to record ideas which are refined and organized in the process of transmitting them to the machine. The typewriter is thus a mechanical aid to the secondary process operation. The <span class="red">gadget</span>, on the other hand, requires a minimum of human intervention and gives the illusion of operating independently.  /  One cannot conceive of a machine performing secondary process operations independently, because in order to accomplish such a function there must also be a primary process. There are, however, a variety of electronic computers that seem almost to be able to think. Cybernetics, as we all know, has viewed the psychic apparatus in terms analogous to those of an electronic circuit and has caused machines to be built that function in a manner that is analogous to human logic.  /  Both patients stressed that the function of a <span class="red">gadget</span> is secondary in importance to its operation, which obscured its purpose to them. Whether it worked or not, in terms of accomplishing what it is supposed to do, was a minor consideration. This does not mean that the <span class="red">gadget</span> did not have to work perfectly in a mechanical sense, because if it did not the <span class="red">gadget</span>eer would be frustrated. What it did mean, to both the patients, was that the human appreciation of what the <span class="red">gadget</span> accomplishes, for example, reproduction of music in such a way as to provide a gratifying and moving experience, tended to take second place in their minds to a pleasure in the operation of the <span class="red">gadget</span> itself.” (336).  “Common among all the patients in this group was anger toward the <span class="red">gadget</span> and the ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>eer’. To define these terms for the purpose of this paper is not easy. Any technological device, especially when first introduced, can be considered a <span class="red">gadget</span>. These patients for the most part objected to two aspects of these devices which may be classified as follows. First, the regulation of time as in switches with either an automatic control or a feed-back mechanism to interrupt a circuit and turn something off or on. Included were such items as furnace controls, coffee makers, and radio switches that turn other mechanisms on and off. Second, enhancement of passivity. In this class can be included practically all objects that do work, and consequently permit more leisure. Automatic dishwashers, automatic transmissions in automobiles, and, especially, remote control of television without getting up from one’s armchair are a threat because of the enhancement of passivity.  Television itself was scorned by one patient who nevertheless succumbed to its lure and then watched it for hours every night. One patient was particularly chagrined to learn there was a switch that automatically controls a fan for ventilating a house, depending on the amount of heat in the attic. That it required a minimum of human intervention for its operation was what this patient found most disturbing.  /  This classification is sketchy and not technologically precise. As it is manifestly impossible to state definitely where invention ends and <span class="red">gadget</span>eering begins, it is striking that these patients frequently made such arbitrary distinctions. Patients pointed out that function was of little importance; the operation of the <span class="red">gadget</span> was the primary feature. One patient spoke with anger of persons who were more interested in the tonal qualities of complex high fidelity sets than in the music. He referred to a recent joke of a person who contented himself with studying the wave patterns produced by an oscillograph hooked into the system.”  (330)  Catalogues patients who can only appreciate photographs and not painting for instance, appreciating technical perfection over beauty.  “In these instances, it is the person who is ingenious, not the machine; and such a person strives to be capable of accomplishing almost anything. The omnipotent qualities of such fantasies are extremely valuable in enhancing narcissism. Such a fantasy, especially when it is as compulsive as it was in both these patients, serves as a narcissistic, omnipotent, magical defense against the inner awareness of a weak and constricted ego” (339).  “To this artist, as it was to the scientist, the <span class="red">gadget</span> served as an intensive means of communicating with reality.”  “In both these patients, the <span class="red">gadget</span> was not only a factor that represented the operation of the secondary process, which is in opposition to instinctual forces, but, more specifically, it was a factor in preserving identity. In the first case, there was a direct correlation between the patient’s interest in <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and security in his identity. In the second case, there seemed to be an inverse correlation; greater preoccupation with the <span class="red">gadget</span> threatened the patient’s ego ideal, and made him feel less secure of his identity.”

  “I fling that statement into the teeth of the sociologists who insist we have never had it so good.  We own machines, they say, to wash our dishes and to blend the hollandaise sauce.  We have <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> to burn our toast, grind up our garbage and dry the laundry on rainy days.  …  <span class="red">Gadget</span>s solve only mechanical problems.  They do not spice stew or mend the linen napkins.  They do not shop for groceries, plan menus, clean the car, entertain, administer, take temperatures or roll bandages for the Ladies of Charity.”  New section:  “The need for a radical <span class="red">gadget</span>.”  “For while machines multiply, so do our responsibilities.  And no <span class="red">gadget</span> can teach us how to best split–perhaps I should say, splinter–our personalities in order to live up to current standards.  Grandmother owned no vacuum cleaner but she also had fewer demands on her skills.  …  She was not expected, as we are, to combine in her one ladylike person the functions of wife, mother, interior decorator, registered nurse, child psychologist, landscape gardener, participator in public affairs, scintillating hostess, director of budgets and general good sport.”

  “New jobs for flashlight cells include everything from polishing shoes to playing records.  Coming soon–truly portable TV sets.”  “A lot has happened since the days when flashlight batteries were used for flashlights.  Today’s big boom in battery power has been made possible by an amazing new assortment of pint-sized power plants, all of which look like flashlight batteries but do remarkably different jobs.  /  Today, you can shave by battery, listen to records by battery, mix cocktails by battery.  You can power radios, movie cameras, dictating machines, Geiger counters, fire and burglar alarms, tape recorders, clocks, kitchen food mixers–all without plugging in an electric cord.  /  In the wonderful world of the future are such bright promises as battery-run power tools, truly portable TV sets and a variety of cordless home appliances.”

  “…the intellectual climate of our time.  We tend to think in terms of mass production and of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  As  far as production of commodities is concerned this has proven exceedingly fruitful.  But if the idea of mass production and <span class="red">gadget</span> worship is transferred to the problem of man and into the field of psychiatry it destroys the very basis which makes producing more and better things worth while.”

  “A  case  history  of a  schizophrenic  child  who  converted  himself into  a  “machine”  because  he  did  not  dare  be  human.  His  story sheds  light  on  emotional  development  in  a  mechanized  society.  […]  To counteract this fear we gave him a metal wastebasket in lieu of a toilet.  Eventually, when eliminating into the wastebasket, he no longer needed to take off all his clothes, nor to hold on to the wall.  He still needed the tubes and motors which, he believed, moved his bowels for him.  But here again the all-important machinery was itself a source of new terrors.  In Joey’s world the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> had to move their bowels, too.  He was terribly concerned that they should, but since they were so much more powerful than men, he was also terrified that if his tubes moved their bowels, their feces would fill all of space and leave no room to live.  He was thus always caught in some fearful contradiction.”

  “Pascual now is claiming for himself a new attitude.  ‘I’m really ready,’ he says.  ‘My arm feels better because of that machine.’  /  The ‘machine,’ according to Herb Heft, chief publicist of the Senators, isn’t quite ‘new.’  ‘It’s a <span class="red">gadget</span> that our trainer, George Lentz, used on only two pitchers–Sid Hudson and Rae Scarborough,’ he explains.  ‘He’d put it away because nobody else had much confidence in it, but now Pascual thinks it’s the greatest invention since atomic energy.’  /  It’s merely a dusted-off <span class="red">gadget</span> that vibrates with a rubber tip, Heft says, but it makes Pascual feel that the only-tired arm of a starting pitcher isn’t his own private hell the next day.”

  “The other thing we want to tell Khrushchev is that if, as the Los Angeles Times says, he is just coming to the United States to be “properly guided and illuminated” so that he will learn that his country does not have anywhere near as much “consumer goods” as the United States has, he should have ‘stood in bed.’ / “Consumer goods”, Nikita, are not all they are cracked up to be, and your people are better off with only half as much as the United States has, especially if they work. / Now, take the American can opener . . . or maybe it has a “made in Jjapan” label, we don’t know. We only know that we buy it at the super market for $1.29 and it has a life expectancy at peak performance of about six weeks. / After that, it takes a Hercules to get the thing to sink its teeth in a can, and then to cling while we laboriously turn the handle, hoping the teeth don’t get tired and ease their bite until the circle is completed. . . . And then, what happens? The top sinks down into the peach or pineapple juice to come to rest right on top of the fruit. . . . whereupon we have to perform an engineering feat with a knife or a fork to get it up out of the can, again. […] For it will become undoubtedly crystal clear to Nikita after he has toured the United States that American consumption of twice as much meat as the Russians has turned them into a lot of meatheads. . . . And then he will go home and release the necessary number of farm hands to build better moons and rockets, also can openers, and other <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, and thus, move the date for outstripping the U. S. up from the Times’ optimistic “1970s” to the 1960s. / Really, aside from the “h’s”, our only word of advice for Nikita is about the can openers. . . . They better work, or comes the revolution, his head will be the first to roll.”

  “[review of John Osborne’s “Look Back in Anger”] I did not know what its message was until suddenly, in the midst of a discussion, I saw a woman who had gotten “pleasantly tiddly” as John Osborne’s main character, Jimmy, says, looking “tenderly and lecherously” into her husband’s eyes . . . and he, poor sucker, rise to the bait, thinking, in spite of himself and in spite of years of such bait that this will be the night when, as Jimmy says, “I’ll make such love to you, you’ll not care about anything else at all,” and she will give herself to him in love at last . . . (for, while women are turning rapidly into den mothers, men remain, for a while longer at least, the hopeful ones; only they “hope”, but they don’t heave to) . . . and then I knew what John Osborne’s play was about. / It was about the fact that we give our bodies—no holds barred . . . that we give materially . . . scuffling and driving ourselves, knifing our neighbors even, to pile riches at the feet of “loved ones.” We give fine cars, trips to Europe, <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, gimmicks. / But we do not give ourselves, so that we have all but lost the power of communicating with each other, and exist side by side like cold blooded polar bears, staring unblinkingly at each other until even the most venturesome is frozen into silence.”
