  <strong>Strong, C.L., 1960.</strong>
  “Some months ago I added a <span class="red">gadget</span> to the tunnel which considerably broadens its utility as a scientific tool.  This consists simply of an electric door bell (with the gong removed) and a chamber with a diaphragm inserted in the smoke circuit just ahead of the ‘rake.’  When properly adjusted, the door-bell-and-diaphragm assembly acts as a chopper to send the smoke out into the tunnel in small puffs or pulses instead of in a continuous stream”

  <strong>Newman, James R., 1960.</strong>
  “Wiener is a fluent writer, but this is not much of a novel.  It has some merit as social criticism, it describes ingeniously the technical stuff (control <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span>) and the patent and corporate chicaneries one can get away with in our society, but the hero is a cold fish, a sort of Armenian trader whom one never gets either to like or to understand.”

  <strong>Blackett, P.M.S., 1960.</strong>
  “Never have Snow’s twin warnings, of the danger of thinking that one weapon will solve our problems, and of the illusion that one can rely on maintaining technical superiority, been more vividly illustrated by the early years of nuclear weapons.  Here the euphoria both of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and of secrecy reached their highest and most disastrous intensity.  Through a blind obeisance to a single weapon the West let down the strength of its conventional forces and failed even to develop prototypes of modern weapons for land warfare.”

  <strong>Butterfield, Herbert, 1960.</strong>
  “The first of the sciences to be placed on a modern footing––that of anatomy–– was one which the artists cultivated and which was governed by direct observation.  It was the artists who even set up the cry that one must not be satisfied to learn from the ancients or to take everything from books; one must examine nature for oneself.  The artists were often the engineers, the designers of fortifications, the inventors of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>; they were nearer to the artisan than were the scholars, and their studios often had the features of a laboratory or workshop.  […]  Science and craftsmanship, combined with the state of the market, enabled them, however, to indulge their zeal for <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, mechanical improvements and inventions.”

  <strong>Tuskegee Institute, Ala;, 1960.</strong>
  “Because she hated to hear her favorite surgeon grumble, Registered Nurse Meloneze Robinson, above, became an inventor. / “Why,” asked Dr. Asa Yancey, also shown, each time he was to perform an amputation, “doesn’t someone devise a simple method to keep the patient’s limb immobile during the operation?” / At her post at the Tuskegee Veterans Administration hospital, Staff Nurse Robinson devised the first amputation surgery limb support, shown above. Dr. Yancey was the first to use the <span class="red">gadget</span> after it was patented after two years work, $800 and tons of anxiety. It has been used over 40 times at Tuskegee by surgeons and may possibly quiet the grumblings of many physicians across the country when it is marketed this year.”

  <strong>Garrett, Randall, 1960.</strong>
  “I had made this <span class="red">gadget</span> – it was a toy for children as far as I was concerned. I didn’t have any idea of its worth. It was just a little <span class="red">gadget</span> that hopped up into the air and floated down again. Cute, but worthless, except as a novelty. And it was too expensive to build it as a novelty. So I forgot about it.”

  “” Yehudi is already at the door, “ she said, and made a face of exasperation. “ Someday I’m going to turn off the <span class="red">gadget</span> that signals the orderly room the minute you get out of bed, so I can have you all to myself. “ “ It’s better if you get used to him, “ Cal cautioned. “ Turn off the signal and that turns on an alarm. Instead of one Yehudi, you’d have twenty rushing in to see what was wrong. “ “ Well, it seems to me a grown man ought to be able to take his morning shower without an observer standing by to see that…”

  “” This is the secret of the power holster, “ Brucco said, tapping the flexible cable. “ It is perfectly loose while you are using the weapon. But when you want it returned to the holster – “ Brucco made an adjustment and the cable became a stiff rod that whipped the gun from Jason’s hand and suspended it in midair. “ Then the return. “ The rod-cable whirred and snapped the gun back into the holster. “ The drawing action is the opposite of this, of course. “ “ A great <span class="red">gadget</span>, “ Jason said, “ but how do I draw? Do I whistle or something for the gun to pop out? “ “ No, it is not sonic control, “ Brucco answered with a sober face. “ It is much more precise than that. Here, take your left hand and grasp an imaginary gun butt. Tense your trigger finger. Do you notice the pattern of the tendons in the wrist? Sensitive actuators touch the tendons in your right wrist.”

  <strong>Leiber, Fritz, 1960.</strong>
  “Somehow the gun had managed to melt itself in the moment of its owner dying. Well, at any rate that showed it hadn’t contained any gunpowder or ordinary chemical explosives, though I already knew it operated on other principles from the way it had been used to paralyze me. More to the point, it showed that the gun’s owner was the member of a culture that believed in taking very complete precautions against its <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> falling into the hands of strangers.”

  “There is nothing so dangerous to a whole nation than a tribe of idle women busying themselves with projects’ of one sort or another. I’d like to hang the men who invented automatic washing machines and other <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>!

  <strong>Kenney, Nathaniel T., 1960.</strong>
  “I saw meanness, nobility, comedy. And tragedy. At first the blazing vitality and power of Africa in ferment frightened me. Amid insistent elbows I knew claustrophobia. But faces go with elbows, and many faces smiled and spoke kind words. These are my fellow humans, yearning for health, education, a place in the sun for | their children, the entrancing <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> of the modern world, respect, peace, and? “ Free-DOM! “”

  <strong>Brecher, Edward, 1960.</strong>
  “At the Acoustical Society of America meeting in Cleveland last October we witnessed the first public demonstration of what noise-abatement officers need most – a lightweight portable meter, designed by Floyd C. Anderson of Boeing Airplane Company, which measures noise simply and directly intones. “ With one of those <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, “ says Trooper Malesky longingly, “ I could really quiet this pike, “ Despite lack of a meter, the Connecticut truck-stopping program has proved reasonably effective.”

  <strong>Rossman, Michael, 1961.</strong>
  “Also, who is to judge at the outset whether a <span class="red">gadget</span> invention is not worthy of a patent?  The telephone, telegraph, movie, radio and television were regarded as mere ‘<span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>’ in their early stages. In fact, nearly all basic inventions must necessarily go through the ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ stage.  The Patent Office policy of resolving doubts in favor of the inventor is thus sound.  It encourages investment which promotes industrial progress.”

  <strong>Mazia, Daniel, 1961.</strong>
  “If mitosis is not desperately discouraging as a problem of molecular biology, it is because the complex operations are embodied in a definite structural assembly––the mitotic apparatus––that can be regarded as a <span class="red">gadget</span> for performing the operations.  We can approach the physics and chemistry of mitosis through the study of the formation, structure and changes of the mitotic apparatus, without forgetting that mitosis is an operation of the whole cell.”

  <strong>Streeter, Edward, 1961.</strong>
  “How in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall? How did one attach anything to a stone wall, for that matter? After the pegboard there would be the paneling. He sat down on an old box and focused on the problem. Perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric <span class="red">gadget</span>. But then, when you stuck things into the holes, why didn’t they come right out again? It all seemed rather hopeless.”

  <strong>Valentine, Helen, 1961.</strong>
  “Make up a package of all the things a new home can’t do without. What? A ball of twine, Scotch tape, a pair of kitchen shears, a box of elastic bands, a package of small pads for marketing lists, a box of sharpened pencils, a tiny tool kit, some pushpins, a new telephone-address book for both husband and wife, a box of kitchen matches, an extension cord, a <span class="red">gadget</span> to unscrew jar lids, and anything else you’ve found you can’t get along without.”

  “” I’ll only draw enough earnings to build me a real, deep-space bubb, nuclear-propelled, and with certain extra <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>. A few guys have tried to follow the unmanned, instrumented rockets, out to the system of Saturn. Nobody got back, yet. I think I know what they figured wrong.

  “Creators of intelligent artificial brains, said Williams, should strive for machines that are designed and built specially for abstract thinking. The necessary hardware will soon be available: electronic units, analogous to brain cells, that can be produced by the billion, be made too small to see with a microscope, send 100 million signals per second, never make mistakes and last indefinitely. Computers made of these wonderful <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and geared for abstract thought should be able to outthink the brightest human brain.”

  <strong>Wallich, Henry Christopher, 1961.</strong>
  “Public needs are underfinanced while private tastes are overindulged? that is the proposition. The two parts of the proposition seem neatly to complement each other? too much of one, therefore too little of the other. In fact they don’t. It is one thing to be irritated by certain manifestations of our contemporary civilization? the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, the chrome, the tailfins, and the activities that go with them. It is quite another? and something of a non sequitur? to conclude from this that the only alternative to foolish private spending is public spending. Better private spending is just as much of a possibility. My contention here will he that to talk in terms of “ public vs. private “ is to confuse the issue. More than that, it is to confuse means and ends.”

  “” When the exhibits come in, I hope you’ll notice that they aren’t just <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> or toys, “ he said. “ To qualify they have to demonstrate a scientific principle or development and do it in an original way – not just an imitation.

  “The holdup killers, shooting up the town and spreading tack’s on the road behind them to hinder pursuit, made, good their escape. As chance would have it, the South Braintree crime occurred at the precise moment when Chief Stewart, Pinkerton? agents and immigration’ inspectors were turning up some curious angles that, Chief Stewart felt, might be related to the Bridgewater holdup - attempt. The Pinkertons had located an improbable witness who claimed to have invented a crime machine. One look into this unlikely <span class="red">gadget</span>, according to, the inventor, would tell you just who committed any given crime. The Pinkertons, skeptical people, weren’t very interested, in the crime machine, but they were decidedly interested in the gossip its’ creator had’ picked Up in the Italian, community. AcCOrding to this, the men involved in the Bridgewater holdup attempt had been Italian anarchists who had been living in a shack near, the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy.)”

  “He opened the hinged top. “ You will see the Space Wave coils at each end of the ship. “ With a pencil he pointed out the odd shaped plastic forms about an inch in diameter that had been wound – apparently at random – with a few turns of copper wire. Except for these coils the interior of the model was empty. The coils were wired together and other wires ran out through the hole in the bottom of the control box. Biff Hawton turned a very quizzical eye on the <span class="red">gadget</span> and upon the demonstrator who completely ignored this sign of disbelief. “ Inside the control box is the battery, “ the young man said, snapping it open and pointing to an ordinary flashlight battery. “ The current goes through the Power Switch and Power Light to the Wave Generator… “ “ What you mean to say, “ Biff broke in, “ is that the juice from this fifteen cent battery goes through this cheap rheostat to those meaningless coils in the model and absolutely nothing happens.”

  “The little <span class="red">gadget</span> that Mike the Angel carried did more than just detect the nearby operation of a vibroblade. It was also a defense. The <span class="red">gadget</span> focused a high-density magnetic field on any vibroblade that came anywhere within six inches of Mike’s body. In that field, the steel blade simply couldn’t move. It was as though it had been caught in a vise. The blade no longer vibrated; it had become nothing more than an overly fancy bread knife.”

The clever instrument that can tell the difference was the hit of an erudite conference that met at Venice to discuss new methods of archaeology. Called a proton magnetometer, the <span class="red">gadget</span> is based on a principle of nuclear physics discovered only a few years ago. The nuclei of hydrogen atoms (protons) are, in effect, tiny magnets, and they line up like compass needles parallel to the earth’s magnetic field. When nudged out of alignment, they oscillate for a few seconds, the speed of their oscillation changing with the local strength of the earth’s magnetism. Buried objects that affect the field show up plainly.”

Perhaps  even  more  alarm­ing  are  two  attitudes  that,  it  seems  to me, underlie  the speed with which some of  the  privacy-invading  practices have taken  root, and  that  are  likely  to  be  the basis for a continuing demand for them. The first attitude can be characterized as an infatuation with <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> and procedures that appear, at least to the layman, to be scientific.  This attitude seems to lead people to fit problems and objectives to the tools that happen to be available.  The second attitude, encouraged by an all too human desire to avoid personal responsibility for decisions is a preference for data and procedures that lend themselves to mechanization, in the belief that the elimination of human judgment is in itself desirable.  I am reminded here of what the late Norbert Wiener used to say (as far back as 1950) with regard to the use of computers.  He stressed that the greatest danger lies in our delegating to computers, out of ignorance or mental laziness, decisions that should remain ours.”

  “Men may think they have more freedom and more choices, he says, but the options open to them are not meaningfully different. In this state, man rejects all thoughts that challenge society’s rationale-hence Marcuse’s definition of man as “ one-dimensional. “ # “ The goods and services that the individuals buy, “ he writes, “ control their needs and petrify their faculties. They have dozens of newspapers and magazines that espouse the same ideals. They have innumerable <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>that keep them occupied and divert their attention from the real issue-which is the awareness that they could both work less and determine their own needs and satisfactions. “”

  “During this time of patriotic feelings, the liberals insure the promise of pay-off from the chosen side, and they begin to send our sons, husbands, and other love ones to assist as a return on that job opportunity. / We look around at the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> we own for the first time, even if they’re not paid for, with a ‘they’re mine’ attitude, and we decide that there is no better place than America, and kiss the men good-by for God and HIS Country. / Six months later, our neighbor, our kin folk, and soon we find that our men will not return, a telegram comes telling they’re dead.”

  “The latest executive nightmare, already spread to epidemic proportions, goes something like this: Widget &amp;; <span class="red">Gadget</span> Corp., dutifully complying with new Securities and Exchange Commission rules, breaks down its consolidated profit and reveals for the first time how much came from widgets and how much from <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, its two lines of business. It turns out that widgets are piling up profits like crazy, but <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are pretty sick.”

  “Within a couple of years. computers will not only pinpoint crime target areas but also automatically assign patrols when and where they are needed, making possible what Reddin. calls “ instant cop? an officer at the scene of a call minutes after it’s made. Hipped on technology, Reddin wants <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> that will permit officers to see in the dark, frisk suspects without touching them, # | and halt speeding automobiles without firing a shot. In his conception of law enforcement, computerization and <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span> are not ends in themselves but will free officers to get at the real task of policing: knowing the people.”
