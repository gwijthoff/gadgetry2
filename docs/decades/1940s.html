  “Ranging from crude clay cups used by the ‘mound builders’ to the latest sanitary nursing bottle, baby-feeding <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> collected as a hobby by Dr. D. Edward Overton, of Garden City, N.Y., record 500 years of history.”

  <strong>Brooks, Walter, 1940.</strong>
  “Our monumental work on the Theory of <span class="red">Gadget</span>s which has been, as they say, on the stocks for twenty years, is nearing completion.  But so, apparently, is civilization [gallows humor in the lead-up to war…].  And in case our publication date does not succeed in anticipating the final crash of Armageddon, we would like to give you a few hints of what these volumes would have contained.  /  Everybody knows what a <span class="red">gadget</span> is, and yet a definition is hard to find.  After deep thought, we give you this:  A <span class="red">gadget</span> is anything which, designed to simplify life, actually complicates it.  We are fully aware that this definition is almost revolutionary in its comprehensiveness.  Yet it is tenable.  It includes everything from a battleship to a fountain pen.  It includes the cigarette lighter that is always running dry, the electric icebox that springs a sulphur leak when eight guests are waiting for cocktails, the automatic shocke that saves two seconds in starting your car every day for thirty days, and on the thirty-first robs you of two hours of your time and two dollars of your money.  It includes most of the things you give your friends for Christmas, And [sic] all that you get.  /  In our chapter on Man and the <span class="red">Gadget</span>, we show how man, the eternal sucker, progresses from enthusiasm to disillusion, repeatedly, all his life long–for the <span class="red">gadget</span> has no experience value.  Elsewhere we estimate the time and money spent on the invention, manufacture, sale, operation, and final frenzied destruction of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  We list al known <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, showing the difference between promise and performance.  And finally, we paint a picture of a <span class="red">gadget</span>-less Utopia, with a few practical hints on how to attain it.  /  The difficulty in completing this work has been in our <span class="red">gadget</span>-testing department.  For obviously, if a single <span class="red">gadget</span> is really found to simplify life, it nullifies our whole argument.  And new <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> appear daily.  We were ready this morning to write finis–when we read of the new false teeth plates which have magnets set in them, with like poles opposing, to keep upper and lower plates apart and in place.  We have always insisted on doing all testing ourself.  Yet we still retain most of our original teeth, and are reluctant to sacrifice them, even to add the final proof to our theory.  For if the magnets don’t work, we have, it is true, the proof, but are just where we were before, and with nothing to chew with.  And if they do work, a lifetime of effort is undone.”

  “How that many important cine accessories are unavailable because of war restrictions placed upon their manufacture, building our own <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> assumes greater importance as one of the most enjoyable phases of our hobby.

  “After all,’ says the concluding sentence in the foreword to an instruction booklet for one of the Filmo cameras, ‘we made the camera, so first try our way of using it.’  There’s a lot of common sense back of that, obvious though it may appear to be.  Over-confidence and eagerness to get going with the new outfit frequently induces people of newly purchased cameras to use the camera before they have read the instructions.  The consequence too often is that something jams because some little <span class="red">gadget</span> was not properly adjusted, although reference to a single line in the instructions would have avoided the accident.”

  “I find that the time can be relied on well within one minute. The glass flask was resorted to in order to protect all essential parts from the birds, who seemed to feel that I had made a <span class="red">gadget</span> for their special benefit. The neck of the flask and a part of the sphere were removed with a ‘biscuit cutter’ (simply a cylinder of sheet metal) and abrasive. The plate of the clock, having nearly twice the radius of the sphere, was spun to its required curvature. All the machining was done on a wood-working lathe and drill press in the pattern shop here at The California Institute of Technology. Figure 5 is a photograph of an­ other spherical globe sun-clock made earlier and partly similar.  […]  The clock to be described is about my tenth design and its performance has been so satisfactory that I have decided to call it quits and turn the information over to those who may wish to have a <span class="red">gadget</span> in their gardens demonstrating an interesting problem in celestial mechanics.”

  <strong>West-Sackville, Victoria, 1940.</strong>
  “What an odd little word ‘<span class="red">gadget</span>’ is, almost a <span class="red">gadget</span> in itself, so small and useful.  Its origin is obscure and is believed not to appear in print before 1886.  Yet it is not, as might be though, an Americanism.  It appears as an expression used chiefly by seamen, meaning any small tool, contrivance, or piece of mechanism not dignified by any specific name; a what-not, in fact; a chicken-fixing, a gill-guy, a timmey-noggy, a wim-wom.  I commend these agreeable synonyms to Mr. Clarence Elliott’s notice, and at the same time record my gratitude for his revival of that other sea-0faring word, manavlins.  I wonder how many English-speaking people are familiar with its meaning?” (197).    “I mistrust <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, generally speaking.  They seldom work.  The proved, old-fashioned tool is usually better and it is safer to stick to it.  I thus make a rule of throwing all tempting catalogues of gardening <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> straight into the waste-paper basket, not daring to examine them first, because I know that if I examine them I shall fall.  It will mean only that I shall with some trouble obtain a postal order for 10s. 6d., to acquire an object which will speedily join similar objects rusting in the tool shed.  It should be clear from this that my mistrust of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> is equalled only by my weakness for them, and that no amount of experience can make me find them anything but irresistible” (196).  Among her favorite <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>:  “Then there is the long narrow trowel of stainless steel and it s associate the two-pronged hand fork, both unrivaled for weeding in between small plants, though perhaps there is no tool so well adapted for this purpose as the old table knife with the stump of a broken plaid.” (196)  But the “perfect <span class="red">gadget</span>” is the “widger” – “the neatest, slimmest, and cheapest of all <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> to carry in the pocket.  Officially the widget is Patent No. 828793, but it owes (I believe) its more personal name to the ingenuity of Mr. Clarence Elliott, whose racy gardening style ought to be more widely appreciated.  He invented the widger, its name, and the verb to wig, which, although not exactly onomatopoeic, suggests very successfully the action of prising up–you wig up a weed, or wig up a caked bit of soil for the purpose of aerating it–all very necessary operations which before the arrival of the widget were sometimes awkward to perform.  This small sleek object, four inches long, slides into the pocket, no more cumbersome than a pencil, and may be put to many uses.  Screwdriver, toothpick, letter-opener, widger, it fulfils [sic] all functions throughout the day.  Its creator, Mr. Elliot, I observe, spells it sometimes with a ‘y’: wydger, no doubt on the analogy of Blake’s Tyger, just to make it seem more unusual.  Whatever the spelling, it is the perfect <span class="red">gadget</span>” (197).  Next chapter, “Tool-shed”:  “Different from <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are the time-honored tools which hang in the dusty brown twilight of the tool-shed when their day’s work is done.  The wood of their handles is as tawny as the arms of men who use them: the have a sun-burnt air.  The steel of spuds, forks, and trowels glistens quietly as though it were resting; it has been in contact with the earth all day, and recalls the old expedient of plunging a dirty knife-blade into the soil and withdrawing it restored to a brightness like the flash of Excalibur.  The prongs of forks are burnished as bayonets, the curve of hooks gleaming as sabers.  The big wooden trudges repose peacefully across the handles of the barrow.  The long handles of rakes and hoes dangle in rows, symmetrical as Uccello’s lances.  There is a shelf with all the odd accumulation of labels, green string, hedging-gloves, old tobacco tins full of saved seeds.  A hank of yellow bass hangs from a nail, blond as corn.  The flower-pots are piled, tier upon tier, red as a robin’s breast.  Red and brown, green and golden, steely as armor, dusty as snuff, the tool-shed deepens in shadow as the respite of evening shuts the door and leaves the small interior to the mouse” (199).”

  “Our man in charge of detecting trade-marks reports a wide-spread craze for compounds ending in “matic.”  The word ‘automatic’ is presumably the father to these coinages, since they all seem intended to carry a connotation of self-propulsion.  It is not a new idea.  Oil-O-Matic, which may have been the first, has been the trade-mark for the Williams oil burner for a number of years.  Within the last twelve months or so, however, the style has suddenly and for no apparent reason become extravagantly popular.  /  The automobile industry has been particularly prolific along these lines.  One manufacturer feathers the Hydramatic drive, another the Electromatic clutch, another Powermatic shifting, a fourth the Simplimatic transmission.  The newest models bring the Liquimatic drive and the Turbo-matic drive.  /  The vogue is also extensive in the electrical appliance field.  Examples include the Vis-O-Matic, Aire-Matic and Attach-O-Matic sweepers; the Laundrimatic, Spira-Matic and ABC-O-Matic washers; the Electro-Matic and Touch-O-Matic radios.  There is a Tel-A-Matic iron, and also an Adjust-O-Matic and a Steam-O-Matic.  The Ade-O-Matic keeps things warm on the Center-Matic stove while the Coffeematic processes the java.  Workers in industry ply Multi-matic and Camatic tools, while the Shift-o-matic is an electric typewriter carriage return.  /  Miscellaneous adaptations privilege the consumer to ride on Seal-O-Matic inner tubes; to sit hygienically in a Postur-Matic chair; to wear Glide-O-Matic arch resters while pushing a baby cab equipped with an Adjustmatic gear.  What’s more you can painlessly purchase any or all of the above articles on the Buy-O-Matic loan plan.  And if there is anything left for taxes, you can figure the amount with the Tax-O-Matic income tax chart.  /  It could have been considered inevitable that somebody would come up with Matho-Matic.  Sure enough, somebody did.  It’s the name for the nozzle on the Premier vacuum cleaner.  So far as we know, Roomatic remains unclaimed.  /  P.S.  At this very moment, Junior may be at large with the recently introduced Squirt-O-Matic water pistol.”

  “To fight for democracy and against Hitlerism, we have turned our factories into arsenals–conscious that we are about to deprive ourselves of some of our most-prized comforts.  We are diverting our iron and copper and aluminum to the making of guns and tanks and planes and ships to be used in the defense of democracy.  …  As Christmas approaches, everyone will feel it more and more.  Santa Claus will be on hand, but he’ll have to deal out Defense Bonds instead of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.”  (1)  Included in this list of “luxuries and semiluxuries” to be transmuted into wartime use:  nylon and rayon stockings for powderbags and parachutes, and cotton stockings become fashionable.  Automobile factories reduce car production by 50%.  Steel and other raw materials diverted.  “And although the first 1942 models off the assembly line have the usual chromium trim and <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, when these supplies are used up there won’t be any more.” (2)  “On the search for defense jobs are the salesmen who have made their living from passenger cars, electric appliances, refrigerators, washing machines, and other non-defense machines which are comfortable and useful but not now as essential as planes and guns and tanks and ships.  The factories which have been producing this rich stream of comforts are looking for defense contracts.” (2)  Retooling in automobile plants, for instance, takes 6-8 months.  “On the basis of these two quick surveys, OPM certifies to the War and Navy departments the facts it finds–that half or more of Jonesville’s industrial workers are about to lose their jobs because the Jonesville <span class="red">Gadget</span> Factory can’t get copper, steel, zinc, or aluminum; that the <span class="red">gadget</span> factory has certain specific machinery and that certain items can be used in tooling steel for a gun carriage or metal for a bomber, or castings for a tank, or whatever.” (14)  A plan to retain American workers:  “The men from the filling stations and the <span class="red">gadget</span> factories, the soldiers who are released from the Army, and the skilled workmen who have been producing automobiles, washing machines, and the other useful implements of a high-standard-of-living nation, are turning rapidly into defense workers.” (16)”

  “When you look at the gun illustrated below, note particularly the two little <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> shown under the barrel and the similar <span class="red">gadget</span> on the end of the barrel.  The gun itself is a 20-gage, bolt-action, repeating shotgun with detachable clip of two-shot capacity–and a third in the chamber, if desired.  But the three little <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> comprise the crux of this story, for they are machined choke tubes, easily and quickly interchangeable, thereby producing a three-shot scattergun with full choke, modified choke, or improved cylinder choke, as may be desired.  And by shooting the gun without any tube attached, you get a true cylinder which, although offering no control over the pattern, is still preferred by some shooters.”

  “This strange way of speaking can best be explained if we know what was going on in their minds during that time. Suppose, they said, that one could bombard the nuclei of atoms with charged particles. To obtain these, the experimenter would take simple atoms such as hydrogen, or helium, and knock off the outer electrons by throwing them violently around in an electrical discharge or in some other way. The <span class="red">gadget</span> in which this “knocking off” process occurred would be connected to a large, highly evacuated glass or porcelain “accelerating tube.” The particles could be led into this tube and, by the application of high voltage, could be accelerated or shot against a target covered with the atoms of the element to be investigated.”

  “William Buchele, 2832 Sagamore Road, Toledo, 0., sends us the photo­ graphs shown in Figure 4 and says: “This is a <span class="red">gadget</span> for testing at the focus with a fiat. Light source is a lOO-watt projection lamp. Its housing has cooling flanges to prevent the lamp from overheating.

  <strong>Ingalls, Albert G., 1941.</strong>
  “It’s a lot of fun, as any amateur telescope maker will tell you, to invent, design, and then build <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> to save labor, even if the actual labor saving is minus quantity.  You get your pay when you can step aside and watch them function automatically, with a self-satisfied grin on your face.  Who cares about time, anyway.  /  Top-flight position as Public <span class="red">Gadget</span>eer No. 1 undoubtedly has now been won by Kenneth Richter, 33 Clarence Ave., Bridgewater, Mass, whose star camera works while he sleeps.  It is in storage just now, as Richter is away at Harvard and in summer is running a “Chromocinemataudiographic Expedition, Ltd.’ (possibly ‘limited’ refers to the funds) somewhere between hudson Bay and the N. Pole.  Nevertheless we invited him to remove the bushel from off its light, so the rest of us could see its glimmer.  /  “The desire for the instrument was born of the fact that we have but two seasons in Bridgewater-the cold sea­ son and the mosquito season, and both are too uncomfortable for visual guiding of an astronomical camera. There­fore, about a year’s work was spent overcoming the discomfort of attend­ ing the camera throughout the night­ the exposure is made automatically.  /  At about dark, I go out, lift the cover off the instrument, and pull out the plate holder slide against a stop. Next, I go in and set a clock by my bedside for the time I want the exposure to start, also for the length of time it is to run. Then I work on a mirror, take the girl friend to a movie (though building the thing kept me so broke that this is just wishful thinking) or I go to bed.  /  At, say, 2 A.M., the clock turns on the power.  Outside, the camera springs to life. A small motor swings the flap shutter open, and an electro­ magnet holds it thereafter when the small motor has shut itself off by breaking its own circuit just as the shutter strikes the magnet. The latter is energized by a radio ‘A’ eliminator, to avoid the vibration of the camera that would result from the use of an A.C. magnet. This is a satis­ factory source of 6-v., D.C., well filtered. Meanwhile a synchronous motor drive, using one of the hen’s-teeth 4-watt Warren motors, has started to apply the diurnal motion.  […]  While almost all the <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are simple enough to be foolproof in operation, the drive frequently messes up the work.  Other than that, one might say that it saves me probably 2 hours’ work a week.  The number of hours required to build the machine would, of course, swallow up this saving for several years.  However, I don’t even try to justify it as a net, over-all time saver.  It isn’t.”

  “From now on we shall see a rapid development of electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eering–the non-radio application of radio technique–according to Charley Golenpaul, of the Aerovox Corporation.  /  “I believe the era of electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eering is now opening up in a big way,” states Mr. Golenpaul. “In the first place, the ban on amateur radio communications is not going to leave the enterprising ‘ham’ twirling his thumbs.  Of course many ‘hams’ are already or will soon be in our armed and technical services.  Many will find wartime jobs with other United Nations.  But those remaining on the home front are going to put their experience, equipment, and ambition to work on new and startling applications in the home, shop, factory, and elsewhere, far removed from customary radio practice.  /  “I suppose most radio men have heretofore been too busy with radio proper to find extra time and energy for non-radio or electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eering possibilities. However, many of them now are going to use their ‘rigs’ and parts for new functions.  I can visualize some interesting developments – light-beam telephones for conversing over considerable distances; automatic photo-electric garage-door openers; photo-electric switches turning lights on and off with darkness or daylight; checking the stoking of furnaces or boilers by the chimney smoke; various comparators or instruments for comparing and matching colors and shades; checking solution concentrations and chemical studies by conductivity means; and so on.  /  “As a starter, electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eer­ing can be based on well-known ele­mentary principles and basic circuits long known to radio amI electrical workers. Many industrial plants are already electronic-<span class="red">gadget</span> conscious. I know of radio servicemen who’ve got­ ten themselves good jobs in plants he­ cause of their ability to do things better, quicker, and less expensively by electronic means.  /  “Make no mistake about it, the temporary suspension of ‘ham’ communications may well turn out to he a boost. It will generate a lively in­terest in electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eering. And when ‘ham’ communications are re­sumed again with the return of peace, I venture to predict that electronic <span class="red">gadget</span>eering will comprise a greater field for radio parts, particularly the quality or extra-heavy-duty compo­nents, than all amateur radio activities put together. Furthermore, many a ‘ham’ will find an interesting way of making real money out of his hobby, and that’s something.””

He was a robot of induction–always strong against romantic investigation.  He distrusted intuition.  His technical knowledge was so wide and so minute that on occasion he became a bit of a bore with it.  Yet he never showed off about it.  He used to quietly say: ‘We may as well.’  and then do things, incomprehensible to the layman, with dusting powders, refined chemicals and portable <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, which were carried by his assistant, Polton, in what must have been a compressible box–one of those cases you can squash when they begin to bulge.

Time magazine calls Flesch (as quoted on dustjacket) “Mr. Fix-It of writing.”  Language <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> used to distinguish concrete words (“apple”) from abstract ones (“democracy”)?  * * * “For language consists of two parts: the things we say and the machinery by which we say them.  To express our thoughts, as we have seen, we use sentences; and we cannot express a thought by any single word unless it is able to do the work of a sentence if necessary.  So we can tell the meaningful words apart from the mere language machinery by the sentence test: if a word can form a sentence, it refers to something outside language; if it cannot, it is just a language <span class="red">gadget</span>. This has nothing to do with abstractness and concreteness: it is a linguistic difference.  For instance, the abstract word sin can be sued as a sentence, as in the famous answer to the question ‘What was the sermon about?’  But the next question, ‘What did the preacher say?’ had to be answered by a whole sentence: ‘He was against it.’  ‘Against’ by itself wouldn’t do as an answer; neither would dis- for ‘He disapproved of it.’  That’s because against and dis- are examples of language <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>; they have no meaning except combined with meaningful words in a sentence.  /  Now, the point of all this is that difficult, complex, abstract language is cluttered up with <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>.  If we stick to this purely linguistic test, we can measure difficulty by counting <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, and we can simplify out speech and writing by throwing them out.  /  Language <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, as you have seen, are of two kinds: words by themselves, like against, and parts of words (Affixes), like dis-.  The more harmful of the two for plain talk are the affixes, since the reader or hearer cannot understand what the <span class="red">gadget</span> does to the sentence before he has disentangled it from the word it is attached to.  Each affix burdens his mind with two jobs: first, he has to split up the word into tis parts and, second, he has to rebuild the sentence from these parts.  To do this does not even take a split second, of course; but it adds up””

  “Plastics’ postwar garb is man-size stuff worthy of materials that can swing their weight around in the industrial big leagues.  …  In view of these facts, can you blame the industry for being a little irate over any interpretation of plastics as something out of which lipstick holders and all sorts of <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span> are made?  …  ‘Let’s not talk about new plastic <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>,’ pleaded a spokesman for the Dow Chemical Company recently.  ‘Every manufacturer is being pushed at the present time to produce enough plastics for practical purposes.””

Once these instructions are carried out Rawson snaps an electric switch and you swing like the pendulum of a clock.

  “The homely Philadelphian, often treated by historians as a politician with a spare-time interest in <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>s</span>, was actually one of the great experimental scientists. […]  It is often said that Franklin’ was typically American in his approach to science-a utilitarian interested in science chiefly, if not solely, because of its prac­tical applications. It is true that when he had discovered the action of pointed grounded conductors and proved that clouds are electrified, he applied these discoveries to the invention of the lightning rod. But he did not make these dis­coveries in order to invent a lightning rod! Franklin’s inventions were of two kinds. One type was pure <span class="red"><span class="red">gadget</span>ry</span>; in this class were his inventions of bifocal glasses, which required no recondite knowledge of optical principles, and of a device for taking books down from the shelf without getting up from one’s chair. The lightning rod, on the other hand, de­veloped from pure scientific research. If Franklin’s approach to science had been strictly utilitarian, it is doubtful that he would ever have studied the subject of electricity at all. In the 18th century there was only one practical application of electricity, and that was the giving of electric shocks for therapeutic purposes, chiefly to cure paralysis.”

Radar, rockets, and the atomic bomb, together with plastic automobiles, nuclear power plants, and television sets were regarded as the sole products of science, the reason for its existence, or the chief currency with which to measure its value.”  Example:  “A steel mill is built to make steel.
