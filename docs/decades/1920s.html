  <strong>Connolly, James Brendan, 1920.</strong> “They call out the seconds and she begins to porpoise, adn at zero out of water goes her periscope again and the Herr Kapitan has another look, and it’s a sure bet then he’s all set to blow up the works.  He whistles to the guy Fred to be ready and Fred fixes his eyes on a gadget that shows red and green lights when it flashes.  And the diving rudder man stands about an ninch [sic] closer to his little wheel, meaning he’s all set too.”

  <strong>Wodehouse, P.G., 1920.</strong> “Damn!’ said Freddie softly, and hurried off down the street.  He wondered whether he had made a frightful ass of himself, spraying bank-notes all over the place like that to comparative strangers.  Then a vision came to him of Nelly’s eyes as they had looked at him in the lamp-light, and he decided–no, absolutely not.  Rummy as the gadget might appear, it had been the right thing to do.  It was a binge of which he thoroughly approved.  A good egg!”

Among these things there fell a smudge cigarette lighter.  These instruments were devised by the French on account of their extreme shortage of matches.  The gadget consists of a tiny steel wheel, which strikes a piece of flint, which in turn ignites the smudge.  The only trouble with these things is that they do not always work.”

  <strong>, 1921.</strong> “There were several earlier types which, although they had their defects, were very effective and frequently ‘spotted’ the Kaiser’s subs at distances of several miles and aided our sub-chasers in running them down and giving them the spurlos versenkt with one of our neat little ash cans.  The more modern apparatus upon which I personally worked was not perfected in time to have actual service overseas.  This remarkable ‘gadget,’ which is known as the multi-unit or M.V. Type of hydrophone, consists in general of two lines of twelve equally spaced microphones.  They are mounted – one on each side – below the water line and either beneath a protective ‘blister’ outside the skin of the vessel or sometimes within the forward water tank.”

Also, that it has a Statistical Department and the usual number of factory departments with a foreman in charge of each.  The product is a small machine, which we will call a gadget, and it is composed of a few castings, which are purchased from an outside foundry, some commerical parts, and some parts which are made in the various departments.  The factory has been turning out about thirty machines a day, but, it is desired to increase this output to forty.”

Another contrivance I have used is a small metal clip to pinch round the nail, and this is very effective.”

  <strong>Winters, S.R., 1922.</strong> “The multiplied troubles of the radio operator on board ship, and persistent complaints to the superintendent, have hurried the development of the break-key.  The name was a misfit for early devices with their multitude of levers, wires and contacts.  The delicacy of the equipment was responsible for periodic instruction from the company engineers not to tamper with the outfit.  /  The ‘gadget,’ as it was disrespectfully called, sputtered and flashed at the contacts, and the noises circulating in the telephones further tried the patience of the operator.  Messages were received with uncertainty and traffic was frequently congested.”

I don’t believe they were just rum-runners, even if Murphy and his crowd did find a lot of booze over there, and what was that cigar-shaped sub-sea gadget they were pulling along with ‘em?’  ‘Why, I think that’s all simple,’ declared Tom.  ‘They probably brought liquor in here with the submarine and carried it to the garage in that torpedolike thing.’”

  <strong>Stiles, Commander William C.I, 1922.</strong> “I think that many an officer, when he first studies the mooring board at the Naval Academy, or rather when he is supposed to study it, is at once impressed with its resemblance to a huge spider web, contrived by the devilish ingenuity of man for the purpose of hopelessly enmeshing the poor fly–which is himself.  […]  In either case, if the ship has to shift berth, the tendency is to damn the mooring board as an impracticable ‘gadget,’ and to fail to criticize the manner of its use.  Thus when it comes to a consideration of the less obvious manuvering problems, he is prone to dismiss the whole matter with the assertion tha, like the Peace of God, it ‘passeth all understanding.’  […]  When speaking of mooring board problems, I think not so much of the board itself as of the kind of work involved.  Such problems may be worked out on the actual board, or in many cases on a chart, or perhaps on some kind of specially contrived ‘gadget.’ […]  I have a gadget I use for maneuvering problems instead of the printed forms, locally known as the ‘Wegee Board,’ because it is supposed to predict the future and explain the past.  It is a sheet of white celluloid with an 18”circle on it graduated in degrees.  At the center is the point of a thumb tack inserted from the bottom side and filed down till it barely projects above the board.”

  <strong>Zimmer, George Frederick, 1922.</strong> “Finally, there is the ‘gadget,’ which is employed when insufficient fall [gravitational momentum] is available, in order to push the packages along.”  (209)  “The ‘Gadget.’ – A ‘gadget’ is illustrated in Figs. 302 to 304 (Rownson, Drew, &amp; Clydesdale’s patent).  This device comes into play principally when a sufficient gradient for a gravity runway is unobtainable, and where, therefore, a very slight incline or even a level path, has to be chosen.  A ‘gadget’ may likewise be used for an uphill gradient for stacking purposes (see Fig. 305), or it may take the place of a ‘humper’; generally speaking, a ‘gadget’ will push a steady stream of cases for about 200 ft. on a level path.  This device is made 8 ft. long in order that it may replace an 8-ft. section of a runway without necessitiating any rearrangement of the rest of the lay-out.  The machine consists of an angle frame which may stand on a level floor in case of a stationary installation, or may be mounted on wheels for a portable lay-out; it totally elcloses the elctro-motor and the propelling device.  […]  It would not be practicable for the ‘gadget’ to push cases round the corner; the path must always be in a straight line.  If angles have to be negotiated, this must be done on a gravity run after the cases leave, independently of the pushing influence of the ‘gadget.’”

  <strong>, 1923.</strong> “Somebody has suggested that the installation of thermostats, shutters, etc., is a confession of weakness; that a properly designed cooling plant ought to cool the car without the necessity for tinkering with it to meet the vagaries of the weather.  The fact is, of course, that overcooling is just as objectionable as constant boiling; and that the only way in which a proper mean can be maintained is by a system that modifies its cooling capacity according to the weather.  At the same time, the thing can be carried to an unnecessary degree of fineness.  During the season when thermostats are busy and shutters working overtime, while those who do not possess these gadgets fall back mainly upon the use of newspaper and cardboard shields over the lower part of their radiators, the driver whose front-end design makes it possible for him to slip off his fan belt will be able to achieve much the same result in this way, and with a saving of power.”

The accompanying photographs, showing a method of generating fuel gas for motor vehicles from charcoal, which has been rather extensively tried out in France, illustrates, to our mind, a tendency which has been apparent in Europe since the World War–a tendency to attempt to accomplish by complicated methods what is already being accomplished through simple means.  […]  The apparatus consists of a generating chamber having a grate, firebox and boiler for producing the necessary steam for making the gas.  It appears to be an amazing complication of internal ‘gadgets.’  The gas must be scrubbed, filtered to remove particles of charcoal, and further purified in a centrifugal purifier.

  <strong>Wright, Milton, 1927.</strong> “A College Professor Solves a Mathematical Problem and Becomes a Wealthy Inventor.  Most of us are likely to think of an inventor as eagerly seeking some idea upon which to exercise his genius, and then bending over a work bench surrounded with wheels, wires and miscellaneous gadgets trying first this combination and then that until he works out his invention.  /  He gets his patent and makes the rounds of manu­facturers, all save one of whom laugh at his radical ideas, but that one sees something in it and makes a fortune.  /  The other day we were talking with an inventor who is not like that at all. He never thought of himself as an inventor, never looked for anything to invent, never had any intention of making a lot of money, believes he is weak in imagination-that quality so often considered necessary to success­ful invention-has put in far more time writing a book than he has done in inventing, has done his in­ venting only as a sort of side line and never bothered ped­dling an invention around among manufacturers. All the inventing he does is with a pen and a note book. And yet Louis Alan Hazeltine has made a fortune out of his inventions. The best known of them, of course, is the Neu­trodyne radio receiver.”

  <strong>Wright, Milton, 1927.</strong> “An Industrial Expert Tells Why Manufacturers Must Seek New Inventions to Keep Their Wheels Turning.  […]  “‘Our experience with inventors and with manufacturers indicates that there is a tremendous amount of inventive effort going to waste.  A great deal of free-lance inventing means that the poor inventor spends a vast amount of time and thought and often hard-earned savings working up some useless gadget that nobody will have.  “The inventor must realize that the first requisite of any new invention is that there be a possibility of broad human need underlying it, and ma­ chinery for its distribution that can be made to turn without spending a small fortune.        Let him remember the really outstanding inventions and think of them not as mechanical creations but as things that made it possible for humanity to ride where it had walked; to bridge space with conversation where it formerly required days to transmit messages.  /  Let him remember Gillette’s safety razor. The money on this invention has been made not through the razor but the blades.  /  Gillette’s funda­mental idea from which that invention sprung was that he wanted to get something for which there would be un­ limited repeat business. His hitting upon a blade that could be used and thrown away was a real stroke of genius.  /  This element of need is the thing that has been fundamental in inventions which have won commercial success.  Before he spends a lot of time, therefore, let the inventor check up on the potential market.”

  <strong>Beard, Charles Austin and Marry Ritter Beard, 1927.</strong> “After the long and toilsome rise, American civilization had reached, at the summer solstice of Normalcy, the high plateau of permanent peace and prosperity.  […]  Notes of jubilee drowned the plaintive cries of farmers and the queasy doubts of querulous critics.  According to the golden appearance of things, intensity would create novelty upon novelty, gadget upon gadget, to keep the nation’s machine whirling; inevitably outlets would be found for the accumulations of capital and the torrents of commodities; and employment would be afforded for laborers befitting their merits and diligence.  Articles for comfort and convenience, devices for diversion and amusement were multiplying with sensational rapidity, giving promise of a satisfaction even more gratifying.  Corporations were swelling in size, holding companies were rising to dizzy heights, the tide of liquid claims to wealth were flooding in.”

But the device which may save life in one contingency will be useless in another and all submaries would be handicapped and their buoyancy seriously curtailed for the one problematical case when such apparatus would be useful.  […]  So the gain would be worse than doubtful.  considered purely from the viewpoint of personal safety, all naval officers prefer a ship which can fight to one cluttered up with ‘safety’ gadgets; witness for instance the fact that a battleship carries no life boats.  It is an old saying that ‘a bright look-out is the best lifeboat,’ and that principle applies to every sort of ship.”

  <strong>, 1929.</strong> “You know, of course, that the weak radio impulse that reaches your set by way of the antenna is amplified or strengthened many times before it is converted into the electrical equivalent of sound that you can hear.  This strengthening of the radio signal is accomplished by passing it through several circuits, each of which consists, essentially, of a vacuum tube, a coil of wire, and a queer-looking metal gadget with two sets of metal fins, called a condenser.  You have noticed how some of these fins slide in between others without actually coming into contact, when you turn the knob that tunes the stations.  Moving these fins, or condenser plates, governs the tuning of the individual stage of amplification.  The same result could be obtained by changing the number of turns in the coil of wire, but it is mechanically more convenient to do the tuning by moving the condenser plates.”

Obviously he belonged to that large brotherhood which loves a gadget. Quick to appreciate ingenious novelties, he picked them up wherever he found them, and not only brought them home, but he improved them. One such contrivance was an attachment which he found in Milan, for the hub of his carriage wheel to tell the nummer of revolutions made obviously the granddaddy of the modern speedometer.
